weather traffic and litter do you travel I have travel domestically not internationally seeing other places and how people live in the culture I want to hear about one of your trips the last trip that I went to a San Diego butt out from childhood or as an adult family vacations to Baja in Rosarito Beach can you tell me yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because this weekend is Easter and we usually will go down to East Easter spring break to Rosarito Baja am I have a Bachelors in communication studies because of the open field just doesn't deal with them communication interactively but Performing Arts telecommunications business entrepreneurship so no I'm not at Maxey unemployed what's your dream job I think 200 my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company I would like to open something like the Telecommunications area as a business something do online online services I like to make things with my hands so my next venture with would be to create all-natural soy candles something in that area a mixture mixture of shy and outgoing because I have to observe people in crowds and that's how I usually make a determination if I remain reserved remain open I listen to like a meditation tape or I take a walk or go get a massage Fair oh man I probably yesterday or this morning usually the argument is about me making myself clear Army repeating myself twice no usually gets the other person in trouble tell me about a situation that you wish you would have I redeemed a service from a mechanic who fix my transmission and I had a warranty and I wrote to the Department of Consumer Affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and I decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and I wish I would have have taking the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with a third party which was the Department of Consumer Affairs and because of that I took him to small claims court and I end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so I wish I would have taken the higher road to taking a lower Road I don't tend to feel guilty about too many things tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make hardest decision I don't know financially emotionally emotionally letting go of past relationship the hardest thing to say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing can you tell me about yes it was a relationship of 7 years but that person is already moved on so they want me to be in their life and hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship will always have something to fall back on that sounds really hard oh yeah it is hard tell me about your bag or something that you wish you could erase from your in advance so that I can trace for my memory I don't know there's a lot of events that I just automatically erased from my memory but whatever comes to mind right probably the death of a relative I'm alone and misinformed because I didn't know that they were that sick and I didn't know that they were their days were numbered and I could have had more opportunity to spend time with them and make better a better connection in the last days I'm sorry to hear that tell me about your relationship with you is Fair to Midland are you into your family my immediate I'm very close but distant not very close okay my mother tell me about and yes I she's encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes golden dreams she always encourages me to always stay loose and out there looking for a better opportunity and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other Ventures how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep easy I've been feeling well yes a little stressed but I'm trying to manage that I leave the stressful environment in the past about 3 years ago because I was having issues in my learning environment and I was feeling emotionally attached yeah I was having an issue with a professor who was just very I know you have a very different personality he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school how do you feel I felt I felt like I was in a dishonest environment I felt like I wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class but I had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester have you been diagnosed with depression I think through finding PTSD they were trying to link depression you still go to therapy now no financially I'm not capable and I haven't found a counselor who's willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues I find a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what's what I'm telling them last time I felt really happy I really don't know that's a good question something you did recently that you really enjoy just just do what I want I just relaxed I just relaxed and you know I don't know I don't have any best friends my best qualities that I'm hard-working I'm reliable I'm an excellent friend I'm energetic and I'm going to go get her things that I wish I could change about myself probably be less sensitive don't take things so personally and learn how to help myself before helping others no I don't have any regrets in my life if I could do things differently 10 years ago I probably would have focus and study more and less being out of the house and hanging with friends what are you most proud of in your life baguette have a college education and I'm self-sufficient and I can pay my bills by myself and I'm alive goodbye hi so then where you at that was exactly : Depression Severity=0\\n\\n    Transcript= that was big yes I'm doing fine Mexico when I was young seven years song I've been there like that three or four times for vacation well it's a less stressful I don't know if it's because I'm on vacation but I feel more at peace over there than here well my family moved down here for a better life that was my parents just the weather and different things that you could do you could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains different variety of things to do the traffic and some basically the traffic and that's one of the main things nothing much I've been to New York and Mexico only I just seen you places and finding new locations you know something new like for a trip over I've been to Mexico I've been to the pyramids of I forgot to call in Mexico City and I like to know about finding a lot of my Asian culture since I'm Mexican from Mayan Aztecs I like to see different things like that well that's cool why did drop out but I came back and I'm trying to get back into it right now trying to learn graphic designs well I started liking you know to take pictures doing different things and I like you know going into business I like what the titles about I want to have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free and don't be in relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself how's it going Spectre you know be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how I feel around them I'd like to hear music or you know it was a different thing that case boards or two different things just to unwind well I'm getting better at it you know Hyatt connect I was like 2 days ago I was something about that I needed to pay bills on something that I did not have taken care of but the person he's like more picky about it and I was more know how gross are you know that they want everything right there and then I have a handle you know I have everything there and they just bugging sometimes they don't give you the space that you need to erase all something I felt like I was overwhelmed already had it resolved I just was waiting for a check you know it's not on my control but I already had made the paper proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it it's like you're making an argument and storm in the glass of water the different need thirst couple of them but not so recently because I've been more trying to get my life together but since I made before in the past I dropping out of school and do another different thanks guilting not that much because not really not that I can think right up top of my head the hardest decision I was just on top of my head right now the band the only things that I remember is when I black out or different things like that that I remember nothing like a particular only with my brothers died and different things like that how my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more to trouble and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it don't understand it. You know I like to be with my family and you know I like to go over there to Mexico to I have a half-sister and my grandpa died he was older Mexico so I do I like to have a good relationship with my family my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they have to do to pay the bills that's why sometimes I be like you no running around trying to get everything done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out it's a little hard because they're especially here in Los Angeles there's a lot of different things that you can get into that's not that positive and it's hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff Well normally I just knock out it's not that hard it's like to take me like half an hour or 15 minutes but sometimes I can even wake up even with the alarm they have to wake me up in know my grass wake me up in with the alarm going on it's like so hard Cena I just knock out I do get a little either I'm angry or I don't feel good and then I'll feel bad energy but I still have to know I know I have to do something so I still go through with it I've been swept in the feeling good do you know then that little restless but not that much I have to do stuff so I guess you know for myself to do it no matter how I feel nothing out of the ordinary no the last time iPhone happy that was following the weekend that I would see not going out with a cloud have some fun and they know I was drinking and just relaxing I want winding down ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax when nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know you were going out somewhere tonight place we're staying at home that without getting any calls or in the interruption might just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just be what are doing the other different things like an outgoing guy in a very social but at the same time I'm reserved depending how I feel with people at the cross her feel comfortable with them well I'm changing a lot of my temper and different things drinking things on changing the different things I could get more different things done there's several but mostly is when I'm coming from Mexico that they wanted the meaner you even down there I feel like silly because I went to a store I was regularly dressed and I was the time I wanted to buy something and then they said that that I wasn't belong there and I ended soon as they saw my credit card they kind of change perspective because I saw the Wells Fargo logo they know it's American but they thought it was let you know what is told me it's all ridiculous to me because you go to a place you know you have the money ask for something you can ask for something because you have it and not just the way to kill the time just because they saw a logo of a card that's how that you know it was ridiculous for me no basically to stay more focused on different things that stay in school and then I don't go to not try to control my temper and do different things cuz if I knew what I know now back then he'll be different well I did drop out but I did go back to school and I know I did get my high school and right now I'm deposit to another different thing so right now is getting my high school getting back together right now I'm working to another girl I'm trying to get me know either going back to school so the basic basically getting back to school and finishing the high school for GED awkward like I thought it would : Depression Severity=0\\n\\n    Transcript= when it's always female yes I'm okay thank you I was born in East Los Angeles yes the freedom to explore outdoors with different weather temp out with weather temperature and climate to go skiing or to the beach may be in the same day I think probably the overcrowding and the smog I'm sure you can tell them not not frequently but I have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure I'm the last trip I've taken outside of here was too heavily and that was my second time being there and I enjoyed it more this time because I knew what I wanted to say when I came back and and I was better prepared for Italians and their culturally I felt I wasn't isn't you know I was just better prepared I thought for that trip that would be being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the mist of acres and acres and Acres of grapes with just magnificent human development I actually didn't decide it first to do that I started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and I went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process I learned that I had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and I miss I had a family so I had to make a career choice quickly and so the college offered human development major and I just went right in and used my use my units that I had already acquired towards that particular major in and I'm happy with it I'm currently no I stay at home I have a little one is not so little I'm preparing to go back to work in the meantime I design jewelry well I have three children I have almost four-year-old and then I have two older children 17 and 23 no that your children that the love from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age and everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so I think I'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy and I think that my parents the time that my parents were parents he was just kind of like you know is she fed is she dressed as a house I mean a roof over her head and we're doing greatest parents and we love her and so it wasn't there wasn't too much I felt that that parents thought about in terms of n terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know and so I think it difference differs in that way tremendously fairy clothes outgoing I don't I don't feel uninhibited I feel you know confident to talk to people I probably talk more than I need to I bead I do I design jewelry that's what I do to relax I'm pretty good II well I think I trying not to not to feel or let others know what my emotions are when I'm upset which is not good because if I don't do anything with them then I know that some point it's going to come out and yeah that that's something I have to work on like exercising or something hey with my husband and it was about he asked me whether I thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him I really tired of talking about that same topic well it came it spawned from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if I ever thought about it and what made me I think about cheating and he knows that I've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did I think about cheating and I we've had this conversation a lot of times and I mean not just that but I don't know just about cheating in general and so I just said what I normally said normally is that I haven't cheated in that I did think about that when we were first together and I thought it was just a mere thought and and then his response was I know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just came out I guess irritated me I was really bothered by that and I just started liking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that argument I mean he wasn't yelling at me and was part conversation and part texting not talking at all pretty much any situation that involves my children and if I've yelled because I really don't like if I came to the point where I've had more of yelled it bothers me because I was yelled at a lot and I just feel bad about that and I try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset I might get and results and yelling tell me about the hardest that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah I am I was just talking about yesterday actually and I'll always pregnant and I had wanted I wasn't married yet and I had wanted to be married and but I just didn't think that it was the right time for me and I had pretty much made up my mind that I was not going to keep that pregnancy but I made the decision by myself and when my partner found discovered that I was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because I felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and and earpiece Erica that was probably the hardest decision actually not know I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I've ever had to make I'm sorry the hardest decision that I had to make in my life was whether or not the hospital should I unplug the life life support machine for my father or not that was our decision because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself was beyond who he was and I just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable I was told so I agreed to Amritsar. Not hardly ever too many things running in my mind and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends even though I know that they're going to I mean I'm constantly worried about how they are when they come home and so I really can't fall asleep on the weekends most time but sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting good night sleep I'm just too exhausted I pass out but it's hard very stressed my son is is has been in dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated and it's been really hard yes I've been probably very short Moody irritable well I often think about a lot of things that aren't even happy my mind just goes from when point A to point B and I don't even know how I got there now it's interesting yeah yes about 3 years ago my OBG suggested I I see a psychiatrist yes well I've in the process of changing therapist so it's been about because the program that I was in Lost funding and I lost my therapist. The therapist that I was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and but I did notice when I was in therapy. It was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist I really helped me cope when I picked up my son from when he was released from Gel I go get her probably you know should we use the term Hustler but meaning that I'll I'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family I mean you know legally of course outgoing maybe sometimes a little too for to outgoing for her and compassionate sensitive loyal all the things that remind me of my mother well yelling the yelling part was when just the little things that used to drive me so crazy I can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what not too much really I don't know to go to college right after high school or not right and and that I didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy that are that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life what did I do I visit my son yesterday and that was really good I was happy that he was safe my children and my accomplishments in school and work bye purpavis tilted back and let came off okay maybe stopping it did not get got everything you needed : Depression Severity=19\\n\\n    Transcript= okay move this I'm gonna move this behind your arm if you don't hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today created to talk to people in the states I'm not a saint are you okay yes pretty good as far as my parents Ethiopia yes the beaches warm weather the diverse environment traffic well I'm currently in school I'm studying African studies how did you decide I've always been interested in African studies actually was wanted to help people and I figure that I can help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa making influence kind of in-between I have my shy moments but then when I'm around a group of people that Angela I'm pretty outgoing hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the interacts I normally write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play My Guitar pretty good I don't really get angry or anything like that I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing when was the I actually can't remember the last time I argue with someone okay what's something you feel guilty about all the people I've hurt in the past can you tell me about well I've like cheated on people hurt their feelings intentionally some things I should have done that I regret now well with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now and I probably shouldn't have argue so much as try to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out hardest decision I've ever had to make was man I really don't know actually having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it's just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don't want to be there cuz he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just saying I'm stuck in bed and was just terrible tell me about your relationship with your me and my family are very close we don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it but we've never had that closed collection connection especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to a racial mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of Step each other each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does it kind of awkward but it's okay I think they are out of control I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it I feel like they're being applauded by the media there being applauded by celebrities that they follow and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights I fall asleep like a baby what are you like when you don't say usually creative actually when I can't sleep I'll just stay up and I'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up stuff like that is usually a good thing when I can't sleeps nothing really bad cuz I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that I'm lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm at a Giants and I'm alive and then some some days where I'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking not like my life self I don't know his wife's been like that weighs have those UPS in those downs but they kind of balance each other out no the last time I felt really happy was today I'm just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day I went to see you some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers wrote A good essay so pretty accomplished and I feel like my days just a good day my best friend would describe me as odd most people would describe me as odd I see a lot of odd things I do odd things I'm interested in things that most people aren't Just Like Old literature revolutionary stuff stuff about changing the world but through underground means no I don't I don't live a life of regret I never let fear stop you from doing anything tell me how you spend your ideal weekend I'm reading just hang out with some friends driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure things you wish you could change about your I don't wish I could change anything about myself I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be tell me about a time when someone made me feel really bad this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people have hurt her the ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all my parents can you tell me about I mean although we don't see eye-to-eye the always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day although I never listen to him or I don't choose to listen to him once it happens I learned from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learn to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do no more than me I'm not so much anymore I travel around the LA try to find you sights to see but as far as I don't travel outside I'm discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the Limitless possibilities I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself a few days ago I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert has to offer and it was just enjoyable I felt free away from all this the city's needs buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time feel good I'm most proud that I've always been different that despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird rum otter I think weird things I've always maintained my original mentality sharing your thoughts with me all right : Depression Severity=7\\n\\n

more in the past but not lately no I just think between different places and some learning new things funny things that are fascinating that piqued my interest I think spoken to your cuz I think the first time I went to New York I was quite amazed I know it says still only in America but I just think I'm being from La I didn't think anything or a city could be bigger and more how do you say ostentatious the New York but it was it was quite an experience and I didn't think any place was I I didn't I didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown LA I think times I think Times Square's got us beat too many to mention I I don't even know where to start depends on the situation I like to walk I like to I like to play with my dogs reading anything where I guess I suppose I could just sit still and let my mind go blank I know reading requires some concentration but I noticed things that I don't have to exert myself too much help him relax in the past I've had problems but I'm getting better I probably are good my roommate couple days ago but that happens we're friends loving argument if you will I'm at this roommate about six seven years ago we just kind of got moved around the same Social Circles and just got a loan it's cool I mean it's the he no like we do argue we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person I'd rather have I rather live with then then her she's she's cool how much time do we have is just too numerous to mention my I would know how to answer that I think breaking up with a girlfriend that I truly cared about but knowing going bad just wasn't going to work that was very difficult just weigh pros and cons and just thought I just wasn't going to work no matter how much love or care I brought you a relationship there was something missing and I think that's enough time she invest enough timing just knew it was over no so many I don't have too many regrets by things erased from your memory a lot too numerous to mention I don't know how to answer that the same girl that I broke up with shoes she was a girlfriend best friend of mine are they were separated for 4 several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you don't turn into a relationship and it hurt him currently we do not speak I wish I might regret is I wish I I would have handled that better it's it's funny soon as I as I get older I'm not as close but I still care for him and I still love them and I think they love me I my mother and my father both alive don't interact a lot very close to my older sister my older sister she's just strong no-nonsense she's short yet a firecracker and I've always liked that about Hershey Joey's help make me feel makes me feel comfortable I'm like a another son to her in a way supposed to depends on my stress level would have a lot on my mind I have difficulty sleeping and other times it just I really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio they're watching TV reading and eventually I'll get tired fall asleep Crabby Bill's like anybody else tired listless you know all the normal things I supposed to happen when somebody doesn't sleep well I feel good no not really well no I have not yes I have I was diagnosed probably about but five years ago I think I always knew there was a problem I always knew there was some I think I always knew before I got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and other things that are very hard to explain I just was tired of feeling that way so I thought I'd help I think just the letter g no desire to do anything motivation just wasn't there any normal person buy things up so should I become socially awkward which was a little bit different for me because growing up I was quite talkative I do I'm sorry figure got you a it does I think it does well I think the number one thing on this is what I'm amazed about the temper I think I've it's allowed me to two step back from certain situations not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react they could just calm down for the most part now it's becoming it's becoming routine initially it was very difficult well 5 years old I don't know which one of your kid there is nothing really to got to be sad about your kid my best friend but you were gone I would have a dry sense of humor so you know my best friend would probably I think the the banner back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know fall in love I wish I could be taller I wish I could be more inclined to play basketball so I can become go to NBA and be a millionaire I know that's all I'm realistic but honestly I think I regret Emily asked asked this before me so many don't know where to start advice would you give yourself that's a good one wow well I don't know but yeah that's a good one I got to think about that and I wouldn't want to answer that that's a good one usually were asked what you want you know how you feel pain in 20 years from now looking back I don't know what advice I give myself something I really enjoyed I love there's several things I like to do you know I enjoy

temperature and climate to go skiing or to the beach may be in the same day I think probably the overcrowding and the smog I'm sure you can tell them not not frequently but I have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure I'm the last trip I've taken outside of here was too heavily and that was my second time being there and I enjoyed it more this time because I knew what I wanted to say when I came back and and I was better prepared for Italians and their culturally I felt I wasn't isn't you know I was just better prepared I thought for that trip that would be being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the mist of acres and acres and Acres of grapes with just magnificent human development I actually didn't decide it first to do that I started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and I went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process I learned that I had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and I miss I had a family so I had to make a career choice quickly and so the college offered human development major and I just went right in and used my use my units that I had already acquired towards that particular major in and I'm happy with it I'm currently no I stay at home I have a little one is not so little I'm preparing to go back to work in the meantime I design jewelry well I have three children I have almost four-year-old and then I have two older children 17 and 23 no that your children that the love from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age and everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so I think I'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy and I think that my parents the time that my parents were parents he was just kind of like you know is she fed is she dressed as a house I mean a roof over her head and we're doing greatest parents and we love her and so it wasn't there wasn't too much I felt that that parents thought about in terms of n terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know and so I think it difference differs in that way tremendously fairy clothes outgoing I don't I don't feel uninhibited I feel you know confident to talk to people I probably talk more than I need to I bead I do I design jewelry that's what I do to relax I'm pretty good II well I think I trying not to not to feel or let others know what my emotions are when I'm upset which is not good because if I don't do anything with them then I know that some point it's going to come out and yeah that that's something I have to work on like exercising or something hey with my husband and it was about he asked me whether I thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him I really tired of talking about that same topic well it came it spawned from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if I ever thought about it and what made me I think about cheating and he knows that I've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did I think about cheating and I we've had this conversation a lot of times and I mean not just that but I don't know just about cheating in general and so I just said what I normally said normally is that I haven't cheated in that I did think about that when we were first together and I thought it was just a mere thought and and then his response was I know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just came out I guess irritated me I was really bothered by that and I just started liking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that argument I mean he wasn't yelling at me and was part conversation and part texting not talking at all pretty much any situation that involves my children and if I've yelled because I really don't like if I came to the point where I've had more of yelled it bothers me because I was yelled at a lot and I just feel bad about that and I try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset I might get and results and yelling tell me about the hardest that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah I am I was just talking about yesterday actually and I'll always pregnant and I had wanted I wasn't married yet and I had wanted to be married and but I just didn't think that it was the right time for me and I had pretty much made up my mind that I was not going to keep that pregnancy but I made the decision by myself and when my partner found discovered that I was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because I felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and and earpiece Erica that was probably the hardest decision actually not know I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I've ever had to make I'm sorry the hardest decision that I had to make in my life was whether or not the hospital should I unplug the life life support machine for my father or not that was our decision because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself was beyond who he was and I just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable I was told so I agreed to Amritsar. Not hardly ever too many things running in my mind and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends even though I know that they're going to I mean I'm constantly worried about how they are when they come home and so I really can't fall asleep on the weekends most time but sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting good night sleep I'm just too exhausted I pass out but it's hard very stressed my son is is has been in dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated and it's been really hard yes I've been probably very short Moody irritable well I often think about a lot of things that aren't even happy my mind just goes from when point A to point B and I don't even know how I got there now it's interesting yeah yes about 3 years ago my OBG suggested I I see a psychiatrist yes well I've in the process of changing therapist so it's been about because the program that I was in Lost funding and I lost my therapist. The therapist that I was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and but I did notice when I was in therapy. It was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist I really helped me cope when I picked up my son from when he was released from Gel I go get her probably you know should we use the term Hustler but meaning that I'll I'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family I mean you know legally of course outgoing maybe sometimes a little too for to outgoing for her and compassionate sensitive loyal all the things that remind me of my mother well yelling the yelling part was when just the little things that used to drive me so crazy I can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what not too much really I don't know to go to college right after high school or not right and and that I didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy that are that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life what did I do I visit my son yesterday and that was really good I was happy that he was safe my children and my accomplishments in school and work bye purpavis tilted back and let came off okay maybe stopping it did not get got everything you needed PHQ_Score:\",\n",
