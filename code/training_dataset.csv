I turn on the fan screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got I go fishing play cars at the little casinos around here that's what I do to relax my temper is fine I don't get mad very often when was the last time probably a bad poker hand can you tell me about that yeah and I was trying to cheat me and I caught him so that was pretty much it tell me about a situation that with my wife she died from liver shut down due to alcohol and she was 7 year breast cancer survivor but the alcohol liver killed her and I could have done that little bit differently but that's that's hindsight what's something you feel guilty about I'm just trying to get her some help but she didn't want no help so I could have got her help I would have been had it turned out she didn't want no help tell me about the hardest decisions turn off the machine she lived on machines so I had to turn them off and what's your died from you tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your doing CPR on her in the hospital room living on machines and stuff that's not living have you ever serve yes I have have the firemen in the United States Air Force for 6 years how have you been feeling lately I last couple days been rough other than that I got a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder and trying to get that fixed and I'm working like I said I'm on workman's comp right now so I'm hopefully they get it fixed not really I don't sleep very well at all I got lots of pain in my arm just my my arm getting the right position to sleep a little bit but you move a little bit and you got a lot of pain in your arm sleeping in my sleep for 1 hour but that been in that pattern for quite some time the same way I fight my sleep well you got to get what kind of slavery in your body's resting but your your mind is thinking all the time so no maybe I should have been no a long time ago but I got over it 20 years ago I'm feeling helplessness just couldn't get out of a hole when you get into a whole has no light at the end of the tunnel and eventually comes through not really I just you dig yourself into a hole and hard hole to climb out of it and eventually it will I love my wife Diane and stuff and maybe I was feeling sorry for myself at the time but I just got the whole one had to dig myself out I knew it had to get better someday soon one day at a time she was always on my mind every single day think of what I could have done for her but there was nothing I could do for what continent is the cow just need a little bit of help to get out of the rut that I'm in and I'm getting out of it now so things are looking up on the bright side do you still got I know why did you stop they were telling me the wrong thing I didn't want to hear she's not a witch they said the grieving. Was two or three months seen on had I still think of my dad he died 10 years ago you know I said who who said that I'd be grieving very last that long and they told me to book says that and I said you take your book and shove it cuz some people some people have to grieve longer than others just the way it is do you feel therapy is useful no I don't think so I think you have to deal with your own problems if people all people have different problems in my snow just getting over it how about getting over the loss of the last 10 years my my dad my older sister and my older brother my mother and then my wife in the last 10 years it's been tough It's been real tough on me I got sick a few times end up in the hospital I don't go to therapy anymore I can kind of pretty much do it on my own okay when was the last time I feel happy all the time oh yeah I'm always been a happy happy go lucky kind of guy hanging on but talk to my friends all over the country you know and it said you sound good and that is why I'm good and just you know I got stuck in this rotten pulling myself out and it's just the way it is a positive influence has been done just do it on my own how'd your best friend I seem all time they just go along with the flow just like I go along the floor with them they might do stuff I don't appreciate but that's their own life I'm going on a fishing trip last week out notion had a pretty good time out there and then midnight go to the drag races see all my friends from all over the country some good to see them they're glad to see me so have a good time what are you most proud let's see getting away from drugs and alcohol I was pretty proud of myself I had to do what I had to do and just leave the situation and go to new situation thank you goodbye have a good day,12
430,looks like we may have okay I will step out when she says goodbye answer fun fun thank you I'm from Los Angeles well you can't beat the weather and I just think the familiarity of home just makes me feel comfortable here smog rudeness although it doesn't compare to New York it's people could be unbearable in their rude not as much as I'd like a lately I travel more in the past but not lately no I just think between different places and some learning new things funny things that are fascinating that piqued my interest I think spoken to your cuz I think the first time I went to New York I was quite amazed I know it says still only in America but I just think I'm being from La I didn't think anything or a city could be bigger and more how do you say ostentatious the New York but it was it was quite an experience and I didn't think any place was I I didn't I didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown LA I think times I think Times Square's got us beat too many to mention I I don't even know where to start depends on the situation I like to walk I like to I like to play with my dogs reading anything where I guess I suppose I could just sit still and let my mind go blank I know reading requires some concentration but I noticed things that I don't have to exert myself too much help him relax in the past I've had problems but I'm getting better I probably are good my roommate couple days ago but that happens we're friends loving argument if you will I'm at this roommate about six seven years ago we just kind of got moved around the same Social Circles and just got a loan it's cool I mean it's the he no like we do argue we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person I'd rather have I rather live with then then her she's she's cool how much time do we have is just too numerous to mention my I would know how to answer that I think breaking up with a girlfriend that I truly cared about but knowing going bad just wasn't going to work that was very difficult just weigh pros and cons and just thought I just wasn't going to work no matter how much love or care I brought you a relationship there was something missing and I think that's enough time she invest enough timing just knew it was over no so many I don't have too many regrets by things erased from your memory a lot too numerous to mention I don't know how to answer that the same girl that I broke up with shoes she was a girlfriend best friend of mine are they were separated for 4 several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you don't turn into a relationship and it hurt him currently we do not speak I wish I might regret is I wish I I would have handled that better it's it's funny soon as I as I get older I'm not as close but I still care for him and I still love them and I think they love me I my mother and my father both alive don't interact a lot very close to my older sister my older sister she's just strong no-nonsense she's short yet a firecracker and I've always liked that about Hershey Joey's help make me feel makes me feel comfortable I'm like a another son to her in a way supposed to depends on my stress level would have a lot on my mind I have difficulty sleeping and other times it just I really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio they're watching TV reading and eventually I'll get tired fall asleep Crabby Bill's like anybody else tired listless you know all the normal things I supposed to happen when somebody doesn't sleep well I feel good no not really well no I have not yes I have I was diagnosed probably about but five years ago I think I always knew there was a problem I always knew there was some I think I always knew before I got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and other things that are very hard to explain I just was tired of feeling that way so I thought I'd help I think just the letter g no desire to do anything motivation just wasn't there any normal person buy things up so should I become socially awkward which was a little bit different for me because growing up I was quite talkative I do I'm sorry figure got you a it does I think it does well I think the number one thing on this is what I'm amazed about the temper I think I've it's allowed me to two step back from certain situations not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react they could just calm down for the most part now it's becoming it's becoming routine initially it was very difficult well 5 years old I don't know which one of your kid there is nothing really to got to be sad about your kid my best friend but you were gone I would have a dry sense of humor so you know my best friend would probably I think the the banner back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know fall in love I wish I could be taller I wish I could be more inclined to play basketball so I can become go to NBA and be a millionaire I know that's all I'm realistic but honestly I think I regret Emily asked asked this before me so many don't know where to start advice would you give yourself that's a good one wow well I don't know but yeah that's a good one I got to think about that and I wouldn't want to answer that that's a good one usually were asked what you want you know how you feel pain in 20 years from now looking back I don't know what advice I give myself something I really enjoyed I love there's several things I like to do you know I enjoy playing basketball I love I love watching I love watching all sports for that matter but brings me real Joy the past few years was become a hobby of mine is is rescuing dogs fostering dogs and funding them and homes if it's become quite a hobby of mine and sometimes I find lost dogs and I'm able to find their owner and sometimes I'm not so when I tell you what there's nothing to find the owner and I just found it on her last week for a small dog I found it it was no greater feeling cuz the man told me and told me I was up power that was daughter go was crying when she left so to be able to give her give them back that was no school I think we're somebody that didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating that's something that I take pride in though I don't show it or speak about it off yeah you look like my friend Rachel is funny vines that hair are you guys watching me over there that yes you can see in another look at that was fun. I swear that girl looks like a friend of mine it's that's weird,3
440,when it's always female yes I'm okay thank you I was born in East Los Angeles yes the freedom to explore outdoors with different weather temp out with weather temperature and climate to go skiing or to the beach may be in the same day I think probably the overcrowding and the smog I'm sure you can tell them not not frequently but I have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure I'm the last trip I've taken outside of here was too heavily and that was my second time being there and I enjoyed it more this time because I knew what I wanted to say when I came back and and I was better prepared for Italians and their culturally I felt I wasn't isn't you know I was just better prepared I thought for that trip that would be being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the mist of acres and acres and Acres of grapes with just magnificent human development I actually didn't decide it first to do that I started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and I went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process I learned that I had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and I miss I had a family so I had to make a career choice quickly and so the college offered human development major and I just went right in and used my use my units that I had already acquired towards that particular major in and I'm happy with it I'm currently no I stay at home I have a little one is not so little I'm preparing to go back to work in the meantime I design jewelry well I have three children I have almost four-year-old and then I have two older children 17 and 23 no that your children that the love from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age and everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so I think I'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy and I think that my parents the time that my parents were parents he was just kind of like you know is she fed is she dressed as a house I mean a roof over her head and we're doing greatest parents and we love her and so it wasn't there wasn't too much I felt that that parents thought about in terms of n terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know and so I think it difference differs in that way tremendously fairy clothes outgoing I don't I don't feel uninhibited I feel you know confident to talk to people I probably talk more than I need to I bead I do I design jewelry that's what I do to relax I'm pretty good II well I think I trying not to not to feel or let others know what my emotions are when I'm upset which is not good because if I don't do anything with them then I know that some point it's going to come out and yeah that that's something I have to work on like exercising or something hey with my husband and it was about he asked me whether I thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him I really tired of talking about that same topic well it came it spawned from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if I ever thought about it and what made me I think about cheating and he knows that I've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did I think about cheating and I we've had this conversation a lot of times and I mean not just that but I don't know just about cheating in general and so I just said what I normally said normally is that I haven't cheated in that I did think about that when we were first together and I thought it was just a mere thought and and then his response was I know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just came out I guess irritated me I was really bothered by that and I just started liking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that argument I mean he wasn't yelling at me and was part conversation and part texting not talking at all pretty much any situation that involves my children and if I've yelled because I really don't like if I came to the point where I've had more of yelled it bothers me because I was yelled at a lot and I just feel bad about that and I try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset I might get and results and yelling tell me about the hardest that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah I am I was just talking about yesterday actually and I'll always pregnant and I had wanted I wasn't married yet and I had wanted to be married and but I just didn't think that it was the right time for me and I had pretty much made up my mind that I was not going to keep that pregnancy but I made the decision by myself and when my partner found discovered that I was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because I felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and and earpiece Erica that was probably the hardest decision actually not know I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I've ever had to make I'm sorry the hardest decision that I had to make in my life was whether or not the hospital should I unplug the life life support machine for my father or not that was our decision because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself was beyond who he was and I just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable I was told so I agreed to Amritsar. Not hardly ever too many things running in my mind and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends even though I know that they're going to I mean I'm constantly worried about how they are when they come home and so I really can't fall asleep on the weekends most time but sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting good night sleep I'm just too exhausted I pass out but it's hard very stressed my son is is has been in dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated and it's been really hard yes I've been probably very short Moody irritable well I often think about a lot of things that aren't even happy my mind just goes from when point A to point B and I don't even know how I got there now it's interesting yeah yes about 3 years ago my OBG suggested I I see a psychiatrist yes well I've in the process of changing therapist so it's been about because the program that I was in Lost funding and I lost my therapist. The therapist that I was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and but I did notice when I was in therapy. It was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist I really helped me cope when I picked up my son from when he was released from Gel I go get her probably you know should we use the term Hustler but meaning that I'll I'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family I mean you know legally of course outgoing maybe sometimes a little too for to outgoing for her and compassionate sensitive loyal all the things that remind me of my mother well yelling the yelling part was when just the little things that used to drive me so crazy I can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what not too much really I don't know to go to college right after high school or not right and and that I didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy that are that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life what did I do I visit my son yesterday and that was really good I was happy that he was safe my children and my accomplishments in school and work bye purpavis tilted back and let came off okay maybe stopping it did not get got everything you needed,19

As well as they they help me pretty much pay for school so that and plus I got I got to travel so and and you know like it's always a great opportunity to serve my country you know are you happy you did that I am very happy that I that I join the Navy yes did you ever see combat I did not see any combat honestly it was kind of a struggle it wasn't that easy at first easy well I mean it wasn't difficult but it was a struggle because it's two different Lifestyles you know the natrol the military and civilian lifestyles are two completely different lifestyle so it was a lot more freedom going back and trying to the most difficult part was trying to find a job because I had came out right when the economy crashed so that was the most difficult part of my transition to do after the military I went to school and I had a student job at the it changed me because I feel like it's giving me more driving life to go after the things that I want I feel like I'm slightly more and more discipline honestly I feel like after I join the military I speak up for myself a lot more often how have you been lately I've been feeling great I don't have any complaints I'm happy with my life so lately I've been feeling very happy and then satisfied that's good have you noticed any changes not necessarily in my thoughts but in my behavior I'm finding that I'm taking more of a initiative with work and you know I'm with my peers in my family how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep on a regular basis I find it pretty easy when I don't sleep well I'm not really different I just feel like I have a little less energy throughout the day but that's really the only difference I I'm I'm still the same person no I have not okay have you been diagnosed no I have not when was the last the last time I fell really happy was probably when I got my paycheck yesterday someone has been a positive influence in my life probably my father he's always putting me in the in in the right direction now I'm here he's always give me some great advice just about things of things in life in general you know so I can always go to him how do your best my best friend would describe me as funny outgoing nice sincere yeah something I've done recently that I've really enjoyed there is a a volleyball tournament down in Long Beach it was the the world series of beach volleyball and I enjoyed going to go into that because it was all free they gave out free food it was on TV it was on NBC I got I got to see Kerri Walsh so that made me really happy nice what are you most proud of what am I most proud of I'm most proud to say that I was in the military and I served my country thanks for sharing your thoughts thank you thank you and then you are free the other desk,0
437,okay oh okay yes I'm doing pretty good I was born in Los Angeles I like the diversity of the city all the attractions and things that you can see food restaurant it's like that traffic freeways crime yes I do seeing new places or going back and seeing same places and just enjoying the Lacs and getting away from LA Wellwood said last trip by made with up to the central coast up in Cambria and Pismo Beach area and Solvang standing yeah probably a when I got to study abroad in Madrid Spain when I was a student at UCLA sometimes a child yeah I was I participated in the education abroad program at UCLA where you go live in another country to learn language when you live before year after University study at the University and that it was just a memorable year and experience that I would never forget thanks probably more shy but the that sometimes I could be outgoing I'm more shy in terms of being alive. It takes me it takes time for me to get to know people I mean I'm not a real party person I don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that but if I'm among friends and think like that but I can be for the outgoing with people I know the drink wine yeah I drink wine maybe listen to some nice music pretty good I can I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions oh gosh I wouldn't say it was a real argument it was more like a discussion maybe about finances Maybe money I was just a little irritated but the not really not really strong emotional oh wow guys I can't think of anything at the moment so I'll look for the skip that one maybe eating eating more junk food than I admit to or the hardest decision I ever have to make Maybe buying a home buying a home or remodeling the home spending money for it was a I felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so I could be self-sufficient and independent yes very happy and then I could erase from my mouth when I when I was when I was student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential undiscovered I never enjoyed it I want a race that whole year 1983 it just brought back horrible horrible memories of what I went through when I was student teaching in the discovered that teaching K-12 with no not for me I stood my major was Spanish and linguistics what made you decide I was very good on languages and I thought them I enjoyed taking them and I was just having a good time taking foreign language and I was getting good grades so I thought maybe this is what I should go into foreign languages I was teaching I was in the Delta teacher teaching English as a second language for 30 years and I just recently decided to retire myself I have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters and my father passed away in 2008 and my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members fucked up on the phone the whole time we have pretty good relation with the with my family now pretty easy I don't have any problems if I don't sleep well I'm I may be moving around in the bed and messing up the sheets but that doesn't happen too often pretty good I think I've been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anyting no no no last time I was really happy I probably when spring break came around and with a vacation time and it was time to go on our trip yeah it was a it was a week trip up to Central Coast to Cambria and Pismo Beach and Santa Ynez was just the nice getaway relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden drinking wine and enjoying different sites and eating good food and then buying were going to replenish our dwindling Supply at home I think she would describe me as a kind and sweet and motivated and nice person oh sometimes I wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing I guess I tend to be more reserved so I wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things with really badly about myself probably when I betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when I take them when I tape them singing Christmas carols and I I played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that but it all got resolved at the end we all we became we were all hot it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay probably having done what I did bikes playing at the other people what advice would I give myself 10 or 20 years ago and don't give up just keep keep pursuing what you want never never give up with CU does a hint of a disappointment if nothing if it doesn't work out I'm a I'm a good listener I'm I'm a motivated person I'm hardworking I'm conscientious I'm caring assembly a pretty happy type person something recently when I really enjoyed going to the going to the Festival of books at USC this weekend yeah that Festival of books is it's a festival where they have all these off authors and they have them food demonstrations seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and there is a lot of food and then a lot of authors signing books and things it's a great event for her to get out and end with nice weather to so it's nice to be out there I really enjoyed that thanks I'm most proud of most proud of probably being successful in my work and my life and my marriage and I just basically being happy with myself well you're welcome bye but it oh okay I wasn't sure if I was supposed to bring it over haha,0

488,okay yes fine San Fernando Valley I'll I really like the culture of going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and that have a good public transportation system I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot and that really like to go camping but I don't really travel I think I might have been around 6 months ago I went on a trip with a geology class yeah it was fun I think it's tough to say well I think the first time I went camping was probably really memorable I went to Death Valley and I got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night philosophy yes I don't know I think it just sort of happened I wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then I kind of grew disillusioned like that and I liked all the different ways are all different things I could do with philosophy I don't know but I really like children and I really like cutting their behavior so I think something along those lines might yet I think I'm generally pretty outgoing I can't be shy on my family but when I'm around friends and stuff I I think I'm pretty friendly I'm a lot of times I watch TV or read I think I'm pretty good I don't really get mad I try to think about other things if I start getting mad or I just started trying to focus on my breathing the last time I argue with someone else probably with my boyfriend and I'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was I think it was I wasn't feeling very well and I was having trouble deciding whether I wanted to go to his Department's end-of-year party and he was getting frustrated which I thought was very inconsiderate cuz I wasn't feeling well to begin with well I felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and I really hate when he gets stressed out or I gets angry easily because I just see necessary and it stresses me out I think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother when my oldest little brother does something wrong I tend to be harsh with him we're not as close as my sister and I or my youngest brother and I and so he tends to be hostile back and I think that if I were little bit more gentle might be easier to communicate with him when I was 19 I came home travel party I think around 4 a.m. on a Sunday morning and my. Get really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of that very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year I want my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that I don't live at home I used to be really frustrated with her all the time cuz she has a really quick temper but I think now that I've got a little bit more just so I can see that she does the best she could and I love my siblings I again my little sister and I get along really well she's 4 years younger than me and when when she was around 12 and I was around sixteen was really difficult cuz she a really harsh time for her and she was always Moody and I wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and we get along okay with my my older little brother who's 15 and I think I'm going along pretty well with my youngest brother who's 12 one of the first not the first part one of my first Varsity professors and I really loved her classes and it was really good I'll being in class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that I think it's pretty easy I mean sometimes I have trouble going to sleep but I thought that it's I think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning well I'm really tired I can get grumpy but I think usually I'm just groggy good I'm a little anxious about about getting a job and I'm going to be taking for my school about it's only one class so a lot of free time well I mean it's not the end of the world if I don't get a job but I know that I will eventually so mostly I think I just try not to think about it too much and I tried not to be pessimistic no no well I think last time I felt really happy I went to a party with my boyfriend Matt and does apartment party and I wasn't you know I knew a couple people they are so I felt comfortable but I love that also able to meet new people there a couple kids there a special on the pool and a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun I'm sure probably say that I'm smart pretty intellectual I love to read and to watch really like series films and TV as you're probably all state on fun cuz we like to go out and have fun a lot well I can be really just organized and the packets me in trouble sometimes it will so that's a major loan then and procrastinating tell me about a time when someone I got into a little bit of trouble of few months back and have to go to court and was given 60 some hours of community service and of course I procrastinate and I'm doing that so I have to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem as she yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just a little less talk speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so I understand cuz that's his job but it was not great for me cuz I wasn't I was really anxious in that situation well I would have been 12 + 2 I think I think I would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents cuz I think I was a little selfish and self-involved II I can't really think of anything I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid but everyone does that and I do regret a couple of semesters ago I didn't do so well in school and I got a few W switch I now have to work to get off on my transcripts I think so I am I think I wasn't focusing in school at that time and I didn't see any counselors at school or anything so I definitely couldn't find that I think I probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on Saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding and Jackson picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast Sunday and just like window shopping maybe watching a little bit of TV well-met youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up I'm 10 years older than him so and being the only size of us took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but I'm really proud of how she turned out and and how close we are,0

California that in Los Angeles very much and I got to take the train and lots of trains and public transportation that was fun for me that's normal for them but it's fun fun for me man I got to see family and it was very very nice yes it was outgoing I'm gregarious I do well in crowds and groups I am a good public speaker I'm not so shy I don't think I go fishing 2 days ago I also met I also meditate how do I feel in that moment relaxed at peace calm depends on the situation I argued with the Los Angeles parking people over a ticket that I got that I didn't agree with and is morphed into a horrible situation and I ended the conversation with accepting the situation as it was and not really wanting to deal with it sort of like fuck you it was good oh my gosh the sale of my business I wish I would have handled that differently I didn't have to really sell the business but I got scared and I sold it and I could have handled it in a much different way fear can you tell me about that I was afraid of mounting debts I was afraid of the economy wasn't good this 2007/2008 I was not thinking clearly I was afraid of mounting debts I was afraid of being sued by employees I was afraid of yeah not having enough money I was afraid to be embarrassed I was embarrassed you know for running out of money yeah I would have handled that much different knowing what I know today it was yes I could have I could have downsized I could have downsized sold cars got rid of cars I could have cut hours I could have reduced my expenses and sat tight with it and not and just worked through it to not have reacted out of fear when I got my bachelor's degree in political science from UCLA and I just finished a master's degree in education my dream job my dream job is to not work that's my dream job do not work to be of service to people to you know of two wear casual clothes not have to be at a particular place at a particular time to have time to enjoy you know the one of the things that I like to do like fishing and Hiking being with my nephew's being with kids yeah and not having to work well relationship with family okay so who's alive today is my mom my father died when I was 16 my stepfather died three years ago I lost my mom's alive we have a good relationship she's like and it took a lot of work it took years you know but she's my we're friends you know we do stuff together my sister she lives a half a block away from me my sister lives a block away from me she's got five kids and a husband and a family to contend with and my sister and I don't get to spend a lot of time together anymore she's got her life you know she's busy life the rest of my family is lives in Belgium who I went to go see and some and that's all the family that I have I have an aunt that is very I'm a strange 2 and she lives in Northern California and we never talk because she she ripped off the Family Estate my grandson my grandparents estate she she took all the money and all the stuff and and left her grandkids and her and Mike you know and so her sister and my my grandmother's daughter and grandkids and great-grandkids got zero and it was a few few few million dollars so we don't talk I don't talk we don't talk and it's sad excuse me can you repeat that wowed house if my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man honest funny handsome I have a business owner a businessman that I work for who was it extremely positive influence at least in my professional life I've had a counselor at UCLA who was totally I think of her often and some of the little things that she said to me keep me going in my life now trust the process she told me to trust the process and when people are having trouble and I'm having trouble I take it step back and say you know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it's supposed to be I'm just one more positive influence that I knew in Hawaii that taught me a friend of mine that lives on Kawaii that taught me how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and and I love her a lot too great positive influence healthy healthy influence it's not I have back problems so it's hard to sleep at night and I wake up in the middle of the night sort of stretching and straightening out my back I have a back issue that sometimes more often than not keeps me from sleeping good that's okay I'm dealing with it I'm a little depressed I've been a little depressed I haven't been working as much and I you know I have pain in the mornings and in the evening I have pain throughout the day and night with my back and it's just a little depressing you know I get depressed all so you know just thinking about my business that I sold and you know where I would have been if I hadn't of done that and a general feeling of I've been a little depressed over the past couple of years actually yes well I've been diagnosed many many years ago and I guess depression stays with you although it gets treated and I was diagnosed about two years ago I think I don't know what to ask me that on the questionnaire as well and I sought treatment for it and then my insurance ran out and the prescriptions I couldn't put the do my prescriptions anymore but now I'm back on medication and so I take medication for my depression therapy absolutely I love therapy wow that's huge confidence and self confidence in myself confidence in my decision-making a general feeling of overall content a sounding board you know when I have stuff that's bothering me that I can't go to the I feel that I can't go to the person with I can go to my therapist in a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or I work through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation and in that way I find therapy to be invaluable actually I believe so yes I was I believe it was and he was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what I was that's what I was having and this was within the last five years I think it was looking back now what are we 2013 it was 2009 so 4 years ago I'm not able to deal with like Shell Shocked not able to deal with anything irritable on the phone I mean just just anything would get me to fly off the handle and I'm just not able just shell-shocked and not hiding it my in my house not opening mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with with things that were that I felt were will that were bombarding me I felt overcome and the psychiatrist said that it was supposed to matter stress disorder butts and I was given some medication which I stayed on for a year or so or so and I don't know through Psychiatry and therapist and medication I was able to come out of my shell a little bit about a week ago I was on a hike and up in Malibu and at this beautiful Labrinth that looked over the Pacific Ocean and I was with a friend and we were having lunch and I lay down in the grass and took a nap and I felt content I was happy at that moment at that moment that time a week ago honest sincere smart caring smart good question I'd have to think about that yeah I have regrets in life and everything works out so you know if I could change the past I would have never dropped out of school when I did a long time ago I mean I've since gone back and completed lots of stuff I probably would have gone into the military I think I was going to do that in my early twenties I'm 55 now I sort of regret not doing that at that time I regret selling my business I regret of course I can't control this but I regret that my father died when I was so young and he never really got to know me and I never really got to know him I regret I regret not seeing my grandmother enough before she passed away I regret I mean those are the things that I can think of right now not putting away for retirement I regret when I had the money to do it yeah I mean just here that's what I would say stick with it just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and I when it comes to fear or flight I get the fear and I flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then everything works out wow I'm most proud that I have remained genuine I'm most proud of being who I am and being basically comfortable with that and I'm proud of that I haven't changed to the warp to the world you know for the world I haven't changed I've stayed who I am thank you thank you bye,9
462,alright wonderful okay thanks yeah I'm okay I'm from Los Angeles oh the weather the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid-back miss the driving instead of public transportation and a sporty I really I don't know the lack of I don't know there's not a lot I don't like about Olay it's compared to most cities I really it's my favorite and I've lived around the world I love it I love La a lot I'm sure you can tell by me yes I've lived in Paris and I've been around the world a lot it's just dumb it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to get to experience all the fantastic I'm sites and in in cultures well I mean I I I tended to actually do a lot of them I probably would do them differently I think I'm more developed as a person now I lived in Paris for two years so and I lived in Spain for Spain was fun Spain Madrid is a party town and then and then to these were all work they were all work so that was working so it was on his grind and you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then I mean I still I still love going just to you know vacation spots like a Y A N Dent Tamika I'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff I guess Madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of people that have never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around I might he might have been lying but it was just it was bitching and Africa was pretty much the best Senegal and Madagascar I'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then I did a little bit of a paralegal but that was really just to just to get the just to get the Skype and I didn't really have any concept of what I want to do now I really do I have I was saying to Rachel actually I don't know if you guys are able to overhear I really think that the way the school system goes right now is it just it it turns people into into I'm just a just a doggy dog. You know I don't like the way I think it's told draining the school system right now and I feel pretty bad for everybody so I want to try to fix that that would be my dream job that's so I'm excited like I want to go in a direction that I want to go and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting kids on it more organic Universal you know trajectory I think it could be done I don't think it would be done via any sort of legislation except here and there I mean that always ends up becoming you know facade in Farsi itself anyway but I think there are ways I've always reached kids anyway and I've always felt where I was coming from and so I think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system I guess I'm just a combination of the two I don't think I don't know actually I'm kind of might even be working that out there might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa. Yeah that's cool I definitely try to reflect and stay in a pretty Lucid space is often as possible so a lot of lying down at the moment I'm in transition so there's just a lot of and I hang out with my dog's a lot so that's quite soothing why I try not to do I don't really do anything that's to can't unless it's time for like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise I try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like breaking but you know and I meant I'm assuming I can't believe summer is coming so I'm going to swim some more to when I'm truly outraged it comes out and then I I'm I'm I'm hitting some kind of bad part right next time I'm fighting for my child so there are times when I will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam a little bit but usually pretty much there's always you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker If you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of Sanity can prevail oh well I mean these are also times where I just can't find something in the car and a bit when I argue with people it's been a lot of the times when I'm being flat out you know sabotage drawer definitely when you know I lost my temper dreadfully with unfortunately the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic and a lot of I mean she's pretty much horrible person so I recently lost my temper with her I felt like I mean I I like again I think I should have said this just now I felt in a way good because I get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but I guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with a horrible try to stay but so I mean I didn't feel like shame I really honestly didn't feel shame I didn't I didn't feel there times when I feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but I never really feel bad for being angry about what I'm angry about well when I was pregnant I wish I had like I said I went through such an Awakening about realizing when I was being sort of undermined that that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when I was pregnant I ended up being so disrespected in the place cuz I was being a hippie on the beach for 6 years so I was it felt like I was being so disrespected in the place where I was set to be when the child arrived at I stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan Into the Fire and they got my kid so yeah it's fucked up I don't want to erase anything from my memory I like having everything Consolidated and cohesive I don't and integrated I don't want to erase anything from my memory well did I get it right or did I get it wrong I guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign sign mediation agreement with DCFS in and I should have said no let's just go straight to court because that there is nothing wrong with me I just happened to succumb to an SSI check via bulshit with my mother's and I should have just been you know brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead I chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out over consciousness it's horrific horrendous Borgia quality Intrigue and sabotaged it's bad that's okay someone that I mean there's been you know there's been some some great people that again from a far I have not sort of really achieved a real great ability to build relationships and I'm working through that great writing it right now and I think that's a lot why don't I have my son but as I've grown in developed I have seen encouragement from like-minded souls and you can see that and say that's wonderful and but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to get to that point how is your day not so easy if he says it all I'm being I've been I'm not completely centered and then there's been some actual you know people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walked by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that I'm still pretty Pollyanna doubt I still look forward to head and try to be as pleasant as possible I'm tired and drained and a little bit frustrated because that I know that I've been sort of that I sort of have a bit of my energy and and space being usurped and I can tell and I don't know how to get through that and passed it no no there are I'm basically a very very very happy pretty much list out person but this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that it is it the same trees that were thrown in my Road in childhood before I realize I was such a happy person or thrown there again so I'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know during the day I'll I'll think something completely true and organic and I'll just stare at something to wow that's beautiful and I'll be reminded pretty close to my spirit so I try to stay there 24/7 I'm pretty spiritual that way I mean if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there that you know that I'm this is off you guys that I'm funny and that and that I think that's bad I'm done funny and that I'm good and that that I'm trustworthy Legacy West just not necessarily change but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me I already said I regret the thing with them leaving the place where I could have delivered my son even though I was being abused get the fuck away from your mother you know and like a lot of and and yeah and two open your eyes look what look what's going on I'm proud of my spirit and my Outlook and my my access to what's really going on in the world and my awakeness I'm just proud of me

especially a practice that it becomes very natural so my bed is able to since when I'm not feeling at ease and I naturally breathe and start my meditation process how hot is it it could be hard if you don't practice it everyday or if you're not able to quiet your mind however if you meditate for a long time it becomes a practice like going to the trim or drinking any water you can naturally learn

everything in the world but that I'm not really I don't understand I know my daughter loves me but I don't know if she wants to be with me or not because when somebody talks to you when I say

mouth but it's what really is there I love my daughter she's Angel I'll cut her umbilical cord went out there and put on her first shirt I seen her come out she looked at me right out the stomach she

442,essentially okay alright you're welcome anytime you ready another day pretty well except for dry weather originally I'm from Detroit Michigan yes high back in the 80s it's been awhile the last time it's been about five years not even close more set back out here it's you know you had the weather that's that's that's if I'm not from prominent reason for coming is the weather because maybe better opportunities and the weather yes it took a minute I had to adjust to the different attitudes of the people the surroundings locations and the vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another the weather off of Wonder Never End never snows in in in Southern California to the prospects of starting a business or becoming self-employed and doing what I like to do the people they're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know Becky Sandile from the and was raised in the South where everybody's are cordial friendly High when you passing the streets out here people think that you have some agenda just for saying hello in passing so that's what I don't like about Ali used to used to be on the road a lot I was a truck driver and plus entertainment coach driver for a several I'll Motown bands back in the day so yeah so I'm used to traveling yesterday well this is a this is actually a beautiful country so just doing the countryside of this in different towns different cultures different towns and seeing how they still have the rest of the country Our Lives some not-so-good some bad and some good message Denver Colorado for a couple years which is really a great City and then I lived in Atlanta which is a really great state where is you know you had the Southern Southern attitude Southern attitude what is everybody's friendly and and gets along and and the Sea I've been back and forth across country least 16 to 20 times so yeah it's it's been it's been a venture Arkansas Little Rock where I had to get into a you might want to say hi to Cason with the rednecks down there because you know I'm African-American and down there they're very pretty as you know there that southern I still have this tendency of thinking blacks or any other cultures besides whites aren't valuable people yeah sorry I had an incident down there where it actually turned into a shootout but I'm okay hello about that you change the time on the. Depends on what mood I'm in at the time you know I can't be outgoing cuz I do like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and I know like I said I I did some entertainment before so at clubs are more outgoing and social events more shy I know it's not meditate very good very good because if I let my temper get the best of me I tend to cause more harm than good time to the person time to myself by you no physical altercations or going to jail so yeah I'm very good at controlling my emotions my temper good question okay girlfriend we just recently broke up about two or three weeks ago because of argument about what she thought she could do and what I know she couldn't do what you want to do it anyway so let your argument and argument ended in US breaking up so yeah emotional but I'm 55 and it's not my first break up so I just take it in stride in and move on well it's probably it's no one no no situation actually can be I feel at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time is probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but I would say back in the day back in the 80s when me and my wife broke up I think I could have handled that one better because I was younger more hot-tempered and more irrational so I could have handled that one better yes what's the way I broke with the way I handled that situation well being young and inexperienced and and emotions and attitudes and not being able to communicate with another person on the level of understanding leaving home well it was like okay I'll say it was about 2 in the morning and I just decided to pack up and and and leave without letting anyone know that I was leaving that was like one of the hardest decisions that I have to make it sketchy loving for sketchy my family is in Detroit and Atlanta Georgia I mean California La I have no one out here so I'm basically on my own and I've been on my own for a long time so we communicate and we talked and send Christmas cards Thanksgiving cuz you know and that fact but as far as family is it's sketchy no one I don't know most things that that I don't want to remember I don't sew and I have erased a lot of things from my memory or place them in the closet which I can't open any more till to remember that so but the most thing that I can say is I won't go into detail on it but I answered netware because great bodily harm to a person in the last two weeks with the I've had this heartburn problem so in the last two weeks has been really difficult for me to get some sleep that's why I have a I have in my pocket right now I have a lot of times it's keeping me pretty sedated right now irritable and just need to get things done and I feel like I have a people and things that's against me and trying to block everything that I'm doing to secede and that's been a great disturbance to me yes it is but you know what like I said I take everything with a grain of salt and I keep pushing because you can't stay mad or vengeful at any one person or anyone think too long because it doesn't accomplish anything so I have to keep pushing I know basic I'm still the same I just just keep my I keep my ideas that I need to do and try to accomplish what I need to accomplish post-traumatic stress no yes back in 09 to 2009 crying a lot not trusting suspiciousness of other people so what and I was recommended referred to a medical mental health facility for treatment off and on yes when I feel depressed and feel anxiety building up in me yes I still have to yes because I get a chance to express some of the things that I normally don't express and I can acting like blow off steam or blow off a part of my depression I don't know really really happy when I was really really happy when my girl that just broke up with came from upstate for us to be together rest when I was really really happy and then that's turned around within two weeks but at that point in time when that happened I was really really happy witty witty informative social Macy ABC I need that ship became a counselor because I'm very enlightening a lot of life's problems so my friends would describe me as helpful probably education more education not raising my sons well I might send my my sons were young and age when me and my wife broke up out here and she moved and remarried and she had she had two boys with her and they took on the new husband's name and I wasn't able to raise them like I would have wanted to race patience more patients being more acceptable of other ideas in other people's opinions there's nothing Paisley at home watching movies to myself I'm a Loner my son's you're welcome see you later rapper Savannah why aren't you married didn't answer my last question I asked,6
411,I was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah k okay k okay when I'm done okay and please are you okay with this pretty good New York I moved to LA in the 70s but I asked you what I lived a lot of different places I guess every few years but I travel a lot so I've lived in I've lived in Africa is Lyft in Spain Switzerland Hong Kong 2 what do you enjoy about different cultures food music rituals of everything the smells of colors makes you feel alive excuse me one of my trips I lived in Kenya for about a year I'd say I love horseback riding so when you're viewing other animals when you're kind of Disguise in the scent of a horseshoe can approach the animals a lot closer so it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along you know seeing somebody animals yeah in Kenya probably when I went to a messiah Village and I happen to I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perils that are hand-painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with the Twisted one or not and I happen to enter a Maasai Village for the first time that day and I looked all around in the men were wearing their clothing exactly what the same Twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Maasai and and then they came back and gave me what appear to be some very large what looks like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have liked Wade my ears straight down and and then gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist in the city now you look proper Maasai so but I I just I have a lot of fun I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I'm just you feel alive all your senses are completely you know I woken yeah I think it's not so clear-cut I think a lot of people's are a hybrid of both I mean I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely Brazen and very courageous and other times probably one of my best virtues is I'm very gutsy person so when I really feel passionate about something I Risk Everything To Go Achieve it sometimes I believe that usually will I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I can make decisions quicker and I told him I said well and that you should case you always have no choice in this is what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and I said not really because it's got wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when I get why she always know what the choice were you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98% chance of failure even if it's a 2% chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield your joy so I always go to that ass tits to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another Choice cuz who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yield to no joy sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Departed you said you put your fish what do I do when I'm annoyed I don't want to annoy sometimes like it's because sometimes I can have like it needs to be a little more patient I guess you really have to put yourself and somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy how hard is it not really I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much cuz you're putting other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from your s different situations I've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is when was the last time my sink last time I argued about something go try to remember oh is he goes when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy and something oh I know what it was it was somebody who belong to the Scientology face I inherited I inherited possibly of a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I had like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photos sensitive and I had an you know what episode where was I had a big flare up and I wasn't really feeling well I felt flushed and everything and the scientologists tells me that I needed to be audited and and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware of that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including buddhism's and Scientology believe that things that you have had in your history sometimes a statue or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you had the power of each person as a god-like or Buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I'm on the verge possibly and I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it as I think when I think I'm on the verge I take the sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would say I would say I would have two good part you know help the bad part of a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I contradict healing an enzyme when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that she has hers last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but but I was just I think I'm annoyed and irritated because the scientologists told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had the certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even matter I said of whether he was really took 20 40 courses of whether I've been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years of weather of somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and Benny sitting in a church pew every day doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of somebody who says they were lighting but it's just the way I guess he kept grabbing his you know his face down my throat that after while I was pretty patient with a but then who it was so Papa's that I became irritated especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out him cuz I just didn't want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip cuz you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get hip surgery I mean I believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he flippantly said while you wear a Scientologist believe that past lives can also affect you know what I'm thinking to myself Buddhist of all religions kind of like well known for being believing in in a cause and effect and past life situations and I found my thought you should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but you know I die you know I I I just didn't you no care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it but other than that I mean I don't sometimes to have a little more tact I guess when when in terms of patients I can think of that right away I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital I'm sorry how did you do my brother was supposed to be the strong and supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and I said well you know he's a medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept me know you know bucking these body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and what kind of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard but you know I was after while the you know even the Physicians and even the pastor from that particular you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he did his brain function would have been you know legible that was tell me about Nevada I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've had to block them I really don't know what it is within my makeup which doesn't make me feel like I need to like I don't keep the I have friends that have on mitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger their hatred or their fear and for some reason I feel blessed that I don't have to like I can't really even think of something that I mean I've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they traumatized me in effecting you know my behavior where I would wear I block at that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason so I really can't think of anything I mean does bad things that happen I know that they are but it's not like I feel like a necessary for me to block them because I've been able to you know chaps that sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened pretty easy I can usually make my sleep by Self sleep in any situation if I have a 1 hour flight to San Francisco I could just kind of lean against the window where the pillow have a blanket over and even on our flight pass out before the plane is even taking off from the ground so I can I have literally when I've had little sleep and I very at high energy so I don't really need that much sleep but say like if I'm in Africa and I Bobby potholes unpaved Road and I still need side I need a few moments of sleep I was just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say I think I should take a nap for 15 minutes go like this and through the jostling I could just take a nap for 15 minutes so I don't really have that problem okay pretty okay me and I could deal without the skin flare-ups but you know from the photosensitivity and all that but other than that I'm pretty good spirits have I ever studied what I can still couldn't hear you I'm sorry have you noticed any changes in your I've ever studied changes in my behavior was the word enough I know I just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having great meal laughing just having a good time listening music designing your address regret about my entire life you man or are you talking about just recently or what are you talkin about you know what's funny I find that lot of the negative experiences that are in my life that have happened are falsely been opens up experiences that are that are also great that I have not overlooked root sample I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my old my whole savings ever had to start all over again and sometimes people say to me like are you sure you're okay or are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you want to seek revenge if I was there cuz my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way and he still essentially my whole life savings essentially in a way and tea what got sent to prison or the FBI was involved in her pulse involved I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth and but you know if I hadn't get involved hadn't gotten involved with him and business I wouldn't have had there a lot of Rich experiences and I think sometimes the reason why I don't know why I'm such a positive person but for some reason I'm able to this not that I'm purposely trying to I do see the positive this and even harmful situations I wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish Drummond lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner end up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences a different friendships that I developed during that. Of time and in a way it was a total different life a different world that that would do you know that I would have never have the chance you know to live through if I had not been filed in my ear but of course it cost me financially and but then again I've always been a type of person who your money isn't everything and I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it so there you go and resemble one of my favorite times in my life probably when I lived in Kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad Vision or maybe looking living in mud dong Huts or something and living very primitively I mean it's not like that at all that I and you think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that I mean actually and I'd really didn't have you know that much been many material Goods to the time I mean I had the blast I had probably been one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya that's so good to hear what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago the same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16 to live your life with passion and again like shoes the way I was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions. Wise what will give you a sense of on wonderment what will make you give you Joy and you have to its regardless what the percentage are even if you only have a 1% chance of success you have to go to sad cuz that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life Otterbein your life the fact that I've a two-year to that and been Brazen whatever you want to say have the balls of cuts / like a harness to go ahead and follow my passions and you know I guess people called me somebody strong decisions usually this isn't sorry when you where you remain unscathed usually don't heal Joy that's just Murphy's Law Office just the way it is okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me hi,0
405,essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks thanks go ahead and move his cord behind you didn't get any way hi hello are you okay with this yes okay not too bad I'm from Chicago South Side I'm back in 1978 when I was 18 lately not much maybe once every two or three years compared to the letter A it's totally different you know horrible weather and it's just a whole different atmosphere let's see my mother had moved to Africa I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather I don't know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety of people and now it's my my Homebase you know my friends that are family that's how I like my family is here now I guess the small hug earthquakes traffic just basic things like that really I don't currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and just fun at the fun of it as well let's see what one trip I went to England Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip so that was a nice variety I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France that was fun I'm glad I got to do that that's great do you consider yourself more shy I'm kind of shy by Nature I've tried to grow out of being shy so I'm not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I'm not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level probably with my husband and I can't remember the moment what it was about okay tell me about your relationship with you well when you say my family do you mean my family from childhood or my current family okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and and but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of bed and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship and then there's the husband which like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons and yeah yeah so that that's not good relationship with the husband but but since we have determined that we need to divorce we don't expect anything out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good well I guess our marriage I wish I had noticed early on that you know it was like way off from what I thought it was how do you say oh my God hardest decision I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard well you know we were married and I wasn't content I guess you could say and I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it's because I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard cuz yeah felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that I'm sure there's something well yeah there's some I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent I'm not resend but an event in my recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating I don't think I've ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young and my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say 6 Maybe maybe five anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends your friends and yet I still have this bad memory of what her her mom did to to me that was about 1:10 about 8 years ago I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to in recent years but obviously it still comes up anyway that was that not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to guess well I'm kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and like I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever lately have I been feeling kind of down on myself down on life well I have this pending need for separation / divorce I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it's too late like I missed out on a lot of things and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff so I regret that extremely and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that's the state part of the state of Mo no yes well the first time or or or recently the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I you know it's hard because he didn't want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn't understand this feeling I was really upset how did that was my first time having depression so I didn't really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it's usually a relationship you know yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago no money and I don't have insurance otherwise yeah I'd be happy to go to therapy anything that might help tell me about the last time you felt really happy last time I felt really happy I don't know I guess maybe when my children were born I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it's nice to have them that's I don't know that's all I can remember of that and I guess I don't remember the good times too well I remember the bad times something you did recently that you really enjoy something I did that I really enjoyed well that's the way I am Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun we get to stay in college get my degree get therapy trying to become happy yeah try to figure out things earlier in life like yeah stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like as soon as the saying goes in the songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money in having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don't quit to go traveling and I'll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself not much I guess just my daughter's you know there are two beautiful daughters and I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children some people aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of having my two daughters I'm a very loyal friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating yeah very loyal very happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and yeah I care about people and I'm interested in people and I care about animals as well actually that's another thing I'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in you know I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them so what was the question remember the question okay you're welcome by I did need the tissue one time so that's good the other sister,17
464,alright cool I'm doing good what about you Los Angeles but I couldn't even recited Inglewood we did I answer your question I don't know okay La the murals the ocean what else the people my family is over here so that's the best part what about you I would say the smog yeah the air had to be cleaner and yeah that's what I mean is good people bad people too but yeah for the most part it's all good yeah I've been in Mexico and the temples and it was in California so yes traveling like Tina are that's good healthy for the body cleaner blood flow the people culture and stories and then come back you share stories with like your friends yeah anytime like right now or when okay so I just one time I was a kid we went out to the temples and it started raining so we just start walking through in like when we get to the top one thing I didn't know before is that the higher you go does the smartest steps get so like people back then had on a smaller feet so what happened was as I went higher towards the temple I had to walk sideways so my feet can measure up to that the steps but once you get up there tonight to you I am general education but mainly art yeah I took a lot of art classes well when I was a kid I scribble and walls with Crayola so I figured you know like it kind of stuck around with me so I just posted it so yeah my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art yeah yeah pretty simple it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion persistence and faith and well you just have to really believe in yourself to yourself the more likely you are able to succeed I consider myself to be shy and certain time of places but I am also outgoing when like I have the energy so I feel like it's well-balanced you know like I'm shy when it's I guess okay to be shy you know and I'm outgoing when like the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good like if I make sense but yeah screensaver yeah 2 hour relax either well I'm going to say this but I smoke weed so that helps and I like painting painting humans help me relax you know blue on relax me and also green when I use these two colors and make a painting account calms me down I didn't have a blue shirt yeah my temper well my thoughts and my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah scream until my temporary getting mad or if I do get mad what will be the outcome you know so control my temper is just like training my thought the last time I argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because I wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready I was hungry eating you like nope so that kind of frustrated me and the way I handled it was like well I could just eat when I come back and I'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you not to eat and eat in peace so yeah my family is pretty good my mom and dad have a good relationship and still married and my brothers and sisters we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's a good team a situation I wish I could handle differently would be that's a good question I mean can I get scenario okay situation and kind of differently what you got something I feel like if I'm calm in any situation I could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a Rubik's Cube maybe how to handle the situation would be just buy a feeling I'm feeling making mistakes because I don't make the right mistakes and the right lessons will come after so that's the best way I could answer your question you know yeah deposit influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence influence you know like yeah even though it may hurt like all the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean that actually good influences I was in my friends my mom and dad my brother my sister's yeah we'll see that's the thing like I have I've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day with that did was like give me more insight made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like dispense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kind like scar me a different pair me for like the world you know because it's happened to me when I was like 12 13 years old so if everyday could be exposed to like you know like guns nice and all that stuff so it's it's bad but it's good in a long-term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because you think you might have been through worse so it's not as bad as you know and so yeah the hardest this one right now I don't feel like answering when I got stuck I like kind of think I was part of it but Hearts decision as far as like life-changing life changing whether to continue school college or not I kind of chose to like I went to school but I chose to pursue my own like like I'm there any more advice can I give myself with people who are already in the field I want to be in so that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that I would like run into like the right people but I took that chance you know I'm at the right people so yeah yeah yeah how easy is it for you to get a good night actually really easy I sometimes like I could sleep right now in like 10 minutes you know I just like like soda my air pattern lately I've been feeling good I've been feeling like I have free will like at this point in time I feel like if I chose a path any path with like my heart I could get there you know but I'm kind of like still deciding if I carry sing in August pass or in the air or should I make my own I don't know that's why I'm at I feel like a free will oh yeah ladylike in the past 2 weeks or today okay yeah you know like yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and example right now they just happened right now like this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because yeah it's like it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far I like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that's kind of like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this whole experience yeah post-traumatic stress disorder no depression I know how it's like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no depression how how it feels how does depression feel like it feels like it's like a bird in the cage being depression is like being a fish who can't swim in the water have feeling depression is like being A Bird Without Wings pretty much it feels like you're limited but then a thing is to get out of that depression if I get to awaken and change your perspective and focus on like I would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps yeah being depressed 16 I don't know like it could come like it to happen everyday like it's small doses doses so like I could say today you know earlier when I was just by myself I felt a little depressed then what happened I fixed it like a cut up a friend and met up with him and yeah I mean at this moment I feel pretty happy you know I'm talking to average person is pretty cool and yeah right now if you're happy sometimes hard headed like you would try to teach me a certain investment whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he just described me as like like like Listen by the same thing he'll still do what he wants to do but it's so pretty much like I don't know yeah I mean that's what he tells me but your overall good person I just exercised my diet food my food intake and yeah health I would say when I was like in middle school or in elementary little bit too but yeah it would be was it would either be about will Pumas my heart like something and I thought it was good and then someone else be like all you know that looks kind of like like trash and then I'll be like oh damn I could accept and be like yeah it does kind of look and then fix it or why would do back then we'll be like damn you know you're going to do well and I thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually I'll come out of it but yeah you should use bone people's words and ideas that yeah yeah I said it regret yeah I got a couple things I regret like what well sometimes I feel like I should have completed the whole university thing but I mean at the same time I feel like if I really wanted to go I would have gone so yeah that's kind of regret my head 10 or 20 years ago would be on seek spiritual well-being you know learn how to handle your thoughts to your thoughts I will teach myself pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment Street events you experience and as far as your overall happiness yeah among other things but yeah I'm most proud of right now is my paintings I'm proud of that because like I feel like depends on releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it's like it's one of a kind of Nikes is there you know is Sazon signature something so yeah I'm pretty happy about that yeah thank you are you thinking alright bye yeah,0

490,alright how you doing Northern Illinois two and a half years ago haven't yet since I've been here haven't had a chance to going to go back later this year colder or warmer work took a little while but I got used to it no weather variations comparative traffic sunlight a little bit seeing different things been to Europe a couple of times been around the country visiting Yosemite and Sequoia parks for fun depends on the circumstance most of the time I can fake outgoing or try to be outgoing try to relax and breathe through it and move on depends on the context probably yesterday my children about them not doing what they were told to do arguments with my wife where I should have probably been more patient and understanding sometimes when it's more of a hormonal. Like this week I should just probably breathe through things and recognize that she's going through things and I should just be more patient what else can I do with my life ZZ when I was 19 I could just decide to do strange difficult things and had the boldness to follow through with him Hebrew and Semitic studies and classics kind of I'm in Ministry that's working out the way I kind of wanted to be some embarrassing things when I was a teenager probably what is wrong I talked to my parents about once a day maybe once every other day and I'm constantly talk with my wife and children got four of them they keep me very busy between 9 and 3 sometimes most of the time now character development recognizing that they need space to grow when it works and you see character development and growth and an exploration I have more standards more willingness to enforce standards my wife she's been there for me for 15 years now and help give me the self-confidence to be who I am better now that I'm not drinking as much pop tonight irritable shorter temper pretty good pretty good now I'm doing and making some better decisions with my diet is doing better feel a bit more empowered not as defeatist I was in a process where I wasn't eating very well as an exercising wasn't able to get doing those things I've been doing a little better at that recently passed you weeks and that's been a little bit more encouraging have you ever been no really happy probably a few weeks ago at the beach when everybody was having a good time confident loud intelligent I guess more patient more able to automatically engage with people as opposed to being hesitant at first oh middle school and I was always the low man on the totem pole socially being a constant butt of jokes don't fall in the Trap of thinking that Middle High School is life send you a bill weekend sometime you know if was children and family doing some fun activity Beecher Museum or something some time with the wife sometime just by myself to read and kind of refocus something you did participate in some high-level academic discussions driving able to maintain the standard and quality of life for myself and my family have been able to do so far,2
448,okay great thank you yes doing pretty good all I was born in Brooklyn New York I came out here when I was seven and I've been here ever since I don't consider myself anything but Oak California I'm a welder I just I don't know it was something about making and Building Things and repairing things that intrigue me and I was actually pretty good at it so I stuck with it and and that's my profession T I really never had that I've just kind of always hope that I would have a job that could support myself and my family and I was satisfied with that well I just recently lost my uncle and he raised me since I was 7 years old and other than my wife I don't have any more family he passed away last July and starting to get over it I knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so I've been depressed about that and I'll but I'm doing better it depends on the atmosphere if I'm around people that I don't feel comfortable with kind of reserved but if I'm comfortable and I feel like I fit in I'm not going screensaver right I enjoy old movies old while it's called film Noir and I love those old black-and-white movies and I get on Netflix or Amazon and I try to pick a movie that from back then people were different than day I don't know it's just a different era and I enjoy it my wife says I probably is not as good as I think I do but I've got to admit sometimes I lose my temper and it is according to her over things that I shouldn't be losing my temper about but I'm working on it and I have basically had this problem ever since I was young child oh yes I've been in and out of trouble with the law when I was much younger I'm past that point now but you know when you're young you think you know everything and you know you never going to get old and the future doesn't matter but it does matter because everything that you do when you're young follows you for the rest of your life and I don't regret things that I've done but if I could go back I definitely would make different choices me and my wife we we don't argue we disagree and it's she's very strong-willed and she's a match for me so we go back and forth but we don't get violent and we don't say meaningful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong-willed woman and I am who I am so we kind of go back and forth and lately I have been the one to bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me when I was younger I wish that I didn't follow some of the people that I followed and what I mean by that is no running in a circle with a certain people I am having an ego bigger than my common sense and that's what got me into trouble I was an only child and I kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and getting the girls to laugh or having people think I was going to cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now I'm kind of overweight involving but when I was in my twenties I was at a completely different person and if I would have had some brothers and sisters I may not have thought or acted that way but I was an only child so I you know where and we're people thought I was cool and that got me into trouble tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to hardest decision I ever had to make was giving the authorization to have my uncle passed away he was on life support and his kidneys have failed and doctor said there's nothing more I could do and to not have him go through any suffering to let him slip away Michigan see I get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button I never thought I would have to do that but as I said I'm getting over it and things are getting better slowly my wife she is always there for me she will always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend and she knows me better than I know myself we enjoy doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we mesh we enjoy each other's company we like the same things and we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we we just enjoy each other's company and she like I say knows me better than anybody in the enzyme it surprised me sometimes how is your day you know lately when I can't say lately if I don't excuse me if I don't do a rigorous activity or something that really stresses me or strained my body at let's say for a couple of days I'm just very relaxed and not doing much I just automatically get up after 4 and 1/2 5 hours I mean En Mi y physician now that you're not getting any sleep but I mean I don't feel tired I don't feel so exhausted I don't feel like I need to go back to sleep I'll stay up all day and I'm fine and most people will say that's not enough sleep but you know for me it doesn't affect me well it was some things could be different but I'm not dissatisfied I'm happy with my life that they're like with anybody else there's a few things that I wish would different and I think that's an anybody everybody else has no life but I'm content yeah I feel a little less motivated recently well I can't say recently this was back in January my wife and a few friends were noticing that I was becoming forgetful and I couldn't remember things I didn't see it and you know when they wouldn't everybody brought it to my attention then I started to anyway I went to the doctor and they gave me the test and apparently I have MCI which is mild cognitive impairment and I've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me I'm a man maybe I'm getting better but the neurologist that I saw us as having me come back in a year and going to retest me hopefully it's not the beginning stages of Alzheimer's I'm still a little young for that I'm away from 52 but I was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it could have been due also I was told by him because of the death of my uncle I could have been very depressed and I was not able to retain things and tell work I'm going back in a year and we'll see if I'm any better I'm sorry I'm not understanding you I'm sorry no no I have not yes 2001 I was in a what is the word I'm looking for I was in a in a state of mind of where I was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if I didn't seek any help I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder Waring and thinking too much about things and thinking the worst and I I take medication for that well you know it's not really therapy it's you know every few months you know you got to see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription it's in alphabet you know kind of like the next person next person that is I am with Kaiser so it sits they'll talk to you but it did they give you the impression that you know I okay let's move along you know that they'll hear your explanation but you know they don't have all the time for you that you may want so I'm doing fine now if I really needed help I would I would do something the medication works for me last time I felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is I'm always happy when I'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and I ain't no I'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and I don't have anything else she is my world but I enjoy being with her and we we we do things together and I'm happy all the time when when we're doing that when I'm outside of that Circle I don't know if the sounds right but I'm not seeking happiness I I can only explain it as I'm content I'm not I'm not disappointed or I'm not wanting anything I'm being whatever comes my way is fine so well I don't know why I couldn't give you that answer I want my best friend is my wife but she would describe me is I don't think before I speak I let the littlest insignificant things bother me and I get angry over but the big things it's like I let it go and she's bewildered by that years and years ago she had a classic Pontiac LeMans and she had got into a minor fender-bender and she thought it was going to be the end of the world cuz that was my baby and I don't worry we'll get it fixed and she what she thought was going to hang or something this was as you know it was my baby and she calls you know you you get excited over nothing but you know I ate something like wrecking your car that you love and he put so many hours of work into it money it all gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way I can explain it well I need to lose some weight if you could say I'm definitely been on the eating beans and the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle I'm here I am this is the heaviest ever been in my life and I'm finding it a little bit harder I can't say harder but I'm finding the willpower just say no and stick with it and to go exercise or not you no movement now Gourmet before walking on me and my wife and we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks and we lived in a hey boy you don't look at that wonder what's inside their ER at that's the way that we don't do that no more I guess it's worth a little bit older now and trouble heavy retarded to walk with all this weight but I I I wish I could change that because this is not a healthy size lately no I don't regret anything lately everything's been fine the I could say that the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and I never ever in a hundred years there ever thought that I would face that situation and I'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does don't listen to other people again I'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to he would see the things that I was doing in the pads that I was going down and I constantly thought I knew better and I think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they the young lady that I was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did I I figured I'd never going to God I'm never going to have those problems I wish I could have changed some things the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me and in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that I'm able to do I don't miss them but if I could go back 10 or 20 years I definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions I made my welding certificates I'm certified by the American Welding Society and I have that's probably the biggest achievement that I made for you know myself an accomplishment people that I know say that I'm well I haven't been working on cars lately but they said that I have a natural knack for restoration and working on vehicles and I don't see it but I've been told that once or twice but I I've kind of I've kind of started to slip away from that I don't know why I can't say from lack of interest but I just don't feel the motivation no more I wish I had a pocket of money and I have somebody else to it that's how I feel okay well thank you bye-bye hey okay well I'll tell you know after a couple of minutes,18

Take the train to San Francisco hung out with some of my middle school friends for hella long then yeah it was crazy I was just walking usually arrive bikes everywhere but I was just like walking this this whole time and it was cool I was mad exploring I got I got back home eventually then after that I went directly to Texas and did some shows on the way going to Texas and stayed out there for 8 days and that was really nice of you crazy I don't even know man is so much happiness you know I had fun I went to this place called the Salton Sea and me a bunch of my bicycle friends we all we got in the car is in the way out into the desert and we yeah it was tight we were burning stuff we burn the car we drove the car was like a road warrior type of car and this is crazy man like it was like 50 niggars on one car it was like gnarly we got naked when do you stream I did have a shrooms did have a Molly smoke a ridiculous amount so we'd got retarded drunk so I try to give me some Mexican I don't want to do that but this is like in March before I went on the other trip is like the precursor to my other trip it was the Salton Sea trip but it was tight I saw a lot of nakedness that trip yeah really I'm hell out going how going for sure smoke weed okay what did I study photography photojournalism and yeah is that it got to use a computer for free. To get use bother as cameras for free and I was the Doolittle I would do man-on-the-street type shit with students not man on the street but the ones that you take a picture and say like I forgot what it was called it was long ago nah nah nah nah Nee more this being me and Jay hanging out I rap that's what I do I do little shows around the country and stuff I got a little fan base and I'm sorry you know I'm just doing that he's doing all right I draw to my my dream job is not working a job and being me that's the dream job getting paid for being me so I asked there I'm pretty good back 2 weeks ago that is after hours one I was already like super drunk and tools after hours 3 was after hour or so like man had a bunch of pins these do you take my pens away pins in my like fanny pack I'd like a fanny pack by pins in there cuz I do art is like not.

you got to go now I don't like that wasn't my fault that was your fault but then why that happened my homie was getting like ambushed by the three big ol security guards and then you know what I saw it Ben Hanscom my friend that's when I really lost it and I and the other good luck on my friend right now he's like what you going to do it said I'm like what you going to do and then I hit the ground yet is all over me I put my arm around him and do him to the ground and then it got broken up that was the last time I got angry it was cool as fun life maybe that maybe that situation could have been handled differently it could have been handled differently if they would have been handling things differently than I wouldn't have to react it's not like I was mad I was acting awful reaction I had to act like that because like justice that I couldn't it was on Jessie was like I'm not a mean person at all but when I saw one of my loved ones to get it tagged I had the Black come and like you know like react to that and they were the hot and I mean I was like yeah yeah I think is a tripping like yo chill out is the tiny little white dude your humongous ass Mexican eggs are you need to fall back and I mean it's crazy guilty I don't know I still should sometime from stores when I'm hungry so I got no money I got and I really guilty actually yeah I don't feel guilty about that food should be free and I mean I don't know I like everybody laughs sometime I lie sometimes I feel like a little like idle here and there exaggerations nah nah never the hardest I guess I don't even know what the hardest decision was but I get face with hard decisions and those would be like I got so many friends sometimes I can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend cuz I got to make this is like if I go over this sector the town I'm going to hang out with XYZ niggars I go over here XYZ evening so it's like you know those are hard decisions cuz I never like to let anybody down so

and she's like a little sweet little blind old lady who cooks really good and it's tight I don't know something I could erase for my memory I want to want to erase anything from my memory cuz that'll be like because like the experiences you go through make you who you are who you are I think we've people like that want to erase things or block things out like that doesn't exist I mean there should that's been hard but I would never say I would not want that to happen cuz you know you must have got to learn from the experience you know I mean to be the better you all I see is like a it's like a test you know that bad experience was just testing you got over come and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my God life hard that shitt I don't believe in that I have compassion for people who do get a who do want to do stuff like that but I still like I don't see the logic in it I mean I stay up pretty late and do all sorts of a regular stash it but when I am home it's really easy I can just go to sleep you know when I get tired I get tired lately I've been on this site I've been partying hell it's tough lately like oh my God for at least six days late today coming to do

396,okay thank you thanks for coming in today created to talk to people and it stays are you okay with yes okay Virginia I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more of diversity once a year maybe add song it's a lot slower and there's a lot left to do there I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and I was a lot more going on for me it was really easy cuz I wanted some it was very different and I wanted something different I like I like all the things to do like the Museum's I like the beaches in the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back in bad drivers I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot not as much as I'd like to I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to you that much well I like taking I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places my wife and I like to see you wildlife and Hiking monuments and to seeing different areas well we we've got we went to Central California we'd like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to we went to Hearst Castle in the C the C the elephant seals and things like that I guess I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary we did the who did the tram in the nice hotel on the jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall guess somewhere in between English and film well I am was told I needed to go to college in I haven't quite decided what to do yet so I just pick something I like to do for the time being well wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to I might have done something different like Physical Therapy but are you still working or not I know I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before what made you decide to do that I needed to not starve and it did it it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and ended up being kind of fun dream job is to have money and not have to work for it okay how are you at controlling your temper overall pretty gif I don't remember what about but it probably would have been few weeks ago with my wife all anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone is not listening it drives me crazy now if I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me I don't know I I spent a lot of time on them but I don't I don't know what the hardest one is cuz it if I decide to go with something and you know it's usually for a good reason what's something you feel guilty about well I guess I feel guilty about moving to California in that I left my family and Virginia I mean I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there you know I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them well I mean I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard I have a good relationship with my with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's no problems everyone gets along well very close mean anything anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise depends on how much exercise I have get a lot of exercise is pretty easy if I don't it's not kind of like right now just a little bit swelling out of it but not really too different otherwise how do you been feeling lately I'm just kind of run-down cuz my um my mother-in-law's is dying and we just spent like 3 days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep just some just us just slower and more tired and a little more out of it that's all have you ever been tigers no now usually just when I'm having having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's it's pretty easy for me just getting outside and and and Hiking or exercising not hard for me I'm not sure maybe I'm maybe like eccentric but in a good way hopefully is there anything you regret no 2 be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and two I don't know just just your normal your normal kind of older kind of wisdom can you tell me about that not much just a really everyone realizes things when they get older they wish they had when they were younger what are some things you wish you can change about yourself I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back into shape like I used to be at some the biggest thing right now not much to say just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it cuz it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all smile like you used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit cuz it hurts too much tell me how you spend your ideal weekend probably like during that during the day going going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and Wildlife and exercising and then at night you know if we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that is proud of them proud of moving here and then I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision my parents my grandparents my wife most people in my life have been I think I got everything I need,5
628,like is this okay okay okay thank you I'm going to bring her up bring a l a pretty name does it stand for oh okay oh that's right of equations when she recognizes what you say Okay coolness oh I got it okay Valley let's go I don't want no problems no problem does tracking my facial stuff right now okay that is so need okay party okay okay okay okay sound like a plan okay okay thank you thank you okay yes I'm doing fine thank you California San Pedro California find the weather of course I really love the weather also this is where all my family lives so you know it's good to be around your family and just a lot to do out here I wouldn't say a lot like maybe once or twice per year memorable in a good way I would say having my children at three children so I guess that's the most memorable right now I'm just doing liberal arts so General Studies nothing specific I do take a lot of I do take a lot of science classes because eventually I do want to pursue education in Psychology but that's later on my dream job I really thought about it I don't know honestly I really don't know I wouldn't say shy I'm a little reserved I think there's a little difference oh no not really shy to text me a little bit longer to warm up I don't know I just like to read people before I really open up to them to see how much I'm willing to share and how much I'm not willing to share it's okay I mean I love my family we have our ups and downs specifically I guess with my mother you know is a little bit more up but I'm the only girl so it's expected I have three brothers so with that being said it is what it is it's good when it's good and when it's not good it could be better probably watch TV or you know does not got my pick up a book or something magazine see what's going on in fashion just something to keep my mind off things pretty good I also play games I like to play games on my phone on the computer things like that I wouldn't say I have a temper you know just average you know when things upset me I deal with them but I don't overdo it I don't you know explode or anything like that probably what's today Friday probably my see was it yesterday no day before yesterday actually was with my mom it's it's so funny the argument with about she feels that because I'm a mother a wife and a mother that I should not have a social life meaning I should be at home knitting or something I don't know so it was small that wasn't a big argument just you know I mentioned that I may go to a comedy event and she was against it I said well it's really not your decision I'm an adult so that was about it that's about it recently probably I mean thick I'll probably should have you know oh I know when my husband and I were discussing relocating from California I basically put my foot down and said I wasn't you know willing to do that and I probably should have kept it up in mind because there are some pros to moving or relocating but I guess at the time I really just didn't want to hear it so I just put my foot down and said you know we're not going anywhere with staying here I probably should have been more understanding because he is from you know he's not from California so he's probably feeling a little homesick and I should have took that into consideration guilty probably not spending as much time with my kids it's not because I don't want to spend time with them many not altogether like usually when I spend time with my children it's separate when I always together unfortunately because my middle son has autism so he takes a little bit more time so I wish that you know we could all be together and I do feel guilty about that but it's difficult so I try to give them their own individual time but it hardest decision probably I don't know my former occupation my former job relocated for about an hour and a half away something like that little bit over an hour depending upon traffic and was a good paying job great benefits great people but I had to basically play myself off from that job which did create a financial hardship in my family but I didn't have a choice because of our you know situation with our son and having only one vehicle for transportation if it's a lot of other factors you know I basically had to stop working and that was a big decision but you know I always say happiness over finances you know you can all I can always you know find another job but you know having my family together and being happy that's a different story that's about it oh that's easy probably when I had my face injured when I was in the military yeah I wish I could erase that I mean something that I see everyday when I look in the mirror I don't dwell on it it's just there but it is a mark on my face that I didn't deserve he knows a traumatic experience but it's been about I'm a 15 years or so it's been quite a while but if I could erase it yeah that would be yet yes I was in the Navy for 4 years 19 didn't have any other options it really wasn't planning on joining the military but I didn't want to go back to school at the time I just figured you're going to the military with give me the background that I needed and money for school so that's about that shows yeah I mean can change it I mean I'm not unhappy I'm at a lot of nice people you know so that was good but there was some issues that I had the military that I had not went you know probably would you know when a lot differently but you know you can't change the past no glad I did it I'm not really for that uptight person yeah it's unfortunate you know but now I did it the transition where was it was a little difficult at first you know having to adjust having a fine at the all career and you just not having that how do you say I guess I felt like comfort in the military because I knew that I was always going to have that pay check it out when I was supposed to do I always have a roof over my head you know things like that you know the civilian life basically it's your meds you don't know like you lose your job Monday or you know whatever so that's alright transition I got used to it pretty quickly thank you I went to school I started working with a Communications company I did some medical care as well got married and have children maybe a little bit more responsible I know that for a fact you know if people my age at the time you know didn't have a lot of responsibility most of my still living at home you know at early age I was out on my own no pay my own bills things like that so it did get a little bit more responsibility I'm feeling okay I already have any complaints I mean I feel fine I don't have any complaints about my life you know it is what it is to take it one day at a time that's about it yeah probably nothing really to speak about cheetah and thought yeah nothing dramatic whenever you go to sleep I usually go right to sleep well. As soon as my head hits the pillow but you know I don't I don't talk to her or anything like that very cranky very cranky Laura boy I guess no not at all no not at all I feel like I'm always happy I don't know if people tell me that all the time and say I'm always smiling and things like that so probably just morning when I woke up thank you my mother as much as we argue you know she's such a strong person and you know she's really been there for me and my kids and I just love when she isn't the person you know how she's always doing things for people to see you know just a good person she means well but she's very opinionated probably Billy Anna how is he is driving he probably say I'm typing to look gullible I don't think that's what she would probably say I don't know could be I want our family vacation we actually drove which was different we usually fly so it was a new experience you know going on the road with the kitties thank you wow that's a tough question oh I didn't really oh you're welcome bye I press the button that last question I didn't really answer it but she said thanks got it so I left it at that I don't know what thank you for should I get an answer okay sorry oldest recorded is Ian sorry they're going to think I'm bored,0
423,okay and please yes feeling well where are you from originally Los Angeles the Greater Los Angeles area people diversity and various entertainment and activities fickle weather traffic and litter do you travel I have travel domestically not internationally seeing other places and how people live in the culture I want to hear about one of your trips the last trip that I went to a San Diego butt out from childhood or as an adult family vacations to Baja in Rosarito Beach can you tell me yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because this weekend is Easter and we usually will go down to East Easter spring break to Rosarito Baja am I have a Bachelors in communication studies because of the open field just doesn't deal with them communication interactively but Performing Arts telecommunications business entrepreneurship so no I'm not at Maxey unemployed what's your dream job I think 200 my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company I would like to open something like the Telecommunications area as a business something do online online services I like to make things with my hands so my next venture with would be to create all-natural soy candles something in that area a mixture mixture of shy and outgoing because I have to observe people in crowds and that's how I usually make a determination if I remain reserved remain open I listen to like a meditation tape or I take a walk or go get a massage Fair oh man I probably yesterday or this morning usually the argument is about me making myself clear Army repeating myself twice no usually gets the other person in trouble tell me about a situation that you wish you would have I redeemed a service from a mechanic who fix my transmission and I had a warranty and I wrote to the Department of Consumer Affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and I decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and I wish I would have have taking the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with a third party which was the Department of Consumer Affairs and because of that I took him to small claims court and I end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so I wish I would have taken the higher road to taking a lower Road I don't tend to feel guilty about too many things tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make hardest decision I don't know financially emotionally emotionally letting go of past relationship the hardest thing to say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing can you tell me about yes it was a relationship of 7 years but that person is already moved on so they want me to be in their life and hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship will always have something to fall back on that sounds really hard oh yeah it is hard tell me about your bag or something that you wish you could erase from your in advance so that I can trace for my memory I don't know there's a lot of events that I just automatically erased from my memory but whatever comes to mind right probably the death of a relative I'm alone and misinformed because I didn't know that they were that sick and I didn't know that they were their days were numbered and I could have had more opportunity to spend time with them and make better a better connection in the last days I'm sorry to hear that tell me about your relationship with you is Fair to Midland are you into your family my immediate I'm very close but distant not very close okay my mother tell me about and yes I she's encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes golden dreams she always encourages me to always stay loose and out there looking for a better opportunity and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other Ventures how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep easy I've been feeling well yes a little stressed but I'm trying to manage that I leave the stressful environment in the past about 3 years ago because I was having issues in my learning environment and I was feeling emotionally attached yeah I was having an issue with a professor who

finding PTSD they were trying to link depression you still go to therapy now no financially I'm not capable and I haven't found a counselor who's willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues I find a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what's what I'm telling them last time I felt really happy I really don't know that's a good question something you did recently that you really enjoy just just do what I want I just relaxed I just relaxed and you know I don't know I don't have any best friends my best qualities that I'm hard-working I'm reliable I'm an excellent friend I'm energetic and I'm going to go get her things that I wish I could change about myself probably be less sensitive don't take things so personally and learn how to help myself before helping others no I don't have any regrets in my life if I could do things differently 10 years ago I probably would have focus and study more

play it back in here it was it was different,2
444,yes I'm doing very well today I feel good today Borden Indiana grew up in Bloomington I moved to LA for a job working with the CDC I've only been back twice in the past 20 years my family is not there anymore I went back for high school reunions it's much Greener it's very green a very small very young wooded areas before I played in the woods when I was a kid we summon the corries I rode my bicycle everywhere and here it's a little more cement in traffic it was it just seemed like cement at first but I loved it now and I have friends and I love being able to do so many different things and I go to the beach a lot I took up to the mountains I go camping all the time so I I love it I love it always opportunities I have traveled quite a bit I was in the Peace Corps and I was in South America is in Paraguay for 3 years and I traveled all three South America Brazil Peru Chile Bolivia on a suspended year in London travel through Europe and I used to go to Canada often I'd love to get to Asia one of these days meeting new people at the food I love trying new food in just getting a different perspective on the world and different people's outlook on the world and because America tends to become isolated I hike the Inca Trail when I was in Peru that was a 5 Day hike starting out of Cusco we hiked for 45 days and woke up went the last morning at the sun gate of Machu Picchu and that was just in the most amazing experience cuz I don't need I'd seen about seen it in National Geographic you know all my life so to be there and experience that was phenomenal awesome philosophy of mint green philosophy I minored in art and business and I got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so I decided to study what I wanted to study while I was in college and had the opportunity so that's what I wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher that I had the idea of getting My Philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of Ethics but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how I ended up joining the Peace Corps so it all worked out I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry my alarms going off on my phone it'll die in a second okay inside still going sorry I turned off the phone but I forgot to turn off the alarm Mexico okay I'm sorry what was the question my dream job gosh writing I've done a few scripts and screenplays with a friend of mine but I don't really want to do it the Hollywood thing but writing in teaching and traveling if I could do that overseas are going turn turn off my alarm I can't move okay I can't get to my first okay I'm sorry yes I forgot it's time to go to yoga class I'm terribly sorry about that sorry for the interruption I have an actual fish tank at my house tonight I do the same thing and I do that with my children when they get upset that I put them in front of a spanking is very relaxing I also try to meditate I try and and just sit down and be quiet and gather my thoughts I'd like to read and are sometimes I walk I'll take my dog for a walk I wish I could say I was good at it but usually I I tend to have outbursts every once in awhile when things are getting too chaotic at my house and I am feeling very underappreciated I will have a burst of anger yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that and I've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family I've done it and then instead of recognizing that I'm sad about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and sometimes I just end up walking out the door or going to my room I'm sorry I usually after I have an outburst and I isolate myself for a little bit I can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner I'm sometimes it's very hard. I've gotten to the point where I know just to stop in and get myself out of there and then go take some deep breaths and then really try and figure out what I'm feeling why I'm being angry why why am I being so tense and then be able to verbalize that well it happens a few times when I start getting it had a very tense day and things haven't gone right I tend to have Outburst in the kitchen while I'm making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the TV or and my husband's are bothering me about things that I just don't need to think about right then and one time I just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and I just it just had more pressure building up in building up and actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove really hard just like get people to pay attention to what I was saying and actually made a dent in my stove which is still there so that's that I should have walked out sooner and taking my deep breaths before I did that it was probably when I was pregnant with my first child I wasn't married I had a very good friends so I was I was 32 at the time so I was you know it wasn't young I think if I was younger I probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life I'm like okay I'm going to have this child and I had got pregnant by the man I actually married and still married to but we'd only been dating like 3 months and I was living with a good friend of mine who had been in the Peace Corps with and she in so I didn't know this guy very well I didn't know if we could raise a child together I didn't know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else and my friend suggested that we raise the child together even suggested moving to Costa Rica to raise the child together and so I was a lot of huge decisions that we're going to determine the rest of my life and I made the decision based on more common sense and practicality but I don't regret that decision I think I made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child and they're older now my my oldest is 17 he is at DaVinci Science school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license which I'm very proud of them for the my daughter is 15 and she loves acting she she has a boyfriend who they see just once a week at church basically and they text each other constantly she's a very very typical 15 year old and then I had a 12 year old he is extremely active and is in constant motion and always making noises but I love him dearly he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis no I find it extremely difficult I wasn't my mother had a varied if my dad died when I was young and my mother kind of disconnected when that happened so I didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and I basically raised myself I was kind of on my own from a very young age I mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so I really didn't have parenting skills that you know most people are are raised with I know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and I see my friends that has you know these very innate parenting skills is very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they know everything and know their house is always perfect and it's like I'm just not that person so I I I Tried & B I think I am a very good mother but I'm not a typical mother I think I'm more and more creative a lot of times and we do a lot of things but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing actually when we go camping it's more I'm more homey when I go camping then I am at home I think I'm more tense when I'm at home but I'm trying to factory meditation and things if that's what I'm trying to become calmer and more patient I think my patience is what I need to work on the most and they've been an insomniac all my life I remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and I haven't slept well for a long time but I realize that if I exercise and I do something with my brain intellectually during the day I have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well and that's sometimes that's hard to do and so loud house I stayed stay awake beating I'll read till midnight and then I'll try and go to sleep and usually I don't get back up even if I wake up at 3 again and things of that sort. I'll try to go back to sleep yesterday I didn't feel so good I was I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and was all cloudy and gray yesterday cuz I plan to when you're done working in my garden and then I'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard so I had some more planting to do and I just cooked in kind of feel like doing it so hard to put out about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but today I feel really good I feel more positive I feel more energy I don't know I just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really help me sleep but it was really good because I've needed one for a really long time and I was just kind of excited about being to get delivered in and set up and in that sounds like so mundane but it was you know just like I'm finally doing something positive cuz it's it's something that I put off doing and put off doing put off doing and it was like finally there in concrete and it's like I've done this task that I can check off my list but also I took the kids camping over on spring break and we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and around the campfire and making some more as and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy I don't know I think she believes that I'm more intellectual and smarter than I think that I am at times so she comes to me with a lot of issues she always she always listen to advice remains she thinks I give her good advice and when she doesn't know what to do so I shall ask me and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by just like to complain about because I'm sympathetic or empathetic and I just I'm just there to listen and I don't need to give her any advice so I think it's a good listener in I procrastinate a lot I start projects and I don't finish them so that's what I'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that I started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and I'm very enthusiastic about them when I when I start them and I'll get almost finished and then I don't know what happens I just completely lose interest sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but I'm working on that to get this done oh gosh not following through on the opportunities I had when I got out of the Peace Corps there was a lot of things that I could go and try to go on to get my Master's Degree what are the grants and things so that's where it but instead I got pregnant got married and I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed but then when I got pregnant the second time is right at a time where I had to fight for a directorship and I realized my limitations where I I couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything I needed to do to get a directorship and so I really wish so I resigned and I wish I had stuck with that cuz then I would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding in solid career not base decisions on emotions sometimes I am and not I have some really bad bosses the jobs were wonderful but my ego got in the way and I would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job that goes the the egotistical reactions that I had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well my children actually and also my Peace Corps experience was just phenomenal and people are actually really interesting that they were like an all that they actually know someone who actually did that so that that's why I always when I was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the Peace Corps when it first started and I always said I want to do that one day I want to do that one day I want to do that one day and I finally got to the point where I don't have to shut up or do it so that's that was one of my powdered experiences okay thank you,7
422,what is my hair doing over there so I see myself again it's a little better so this is mimicking her actual positions total ask someone to have a conversation kind of threw her okay thanks hi I'm not a therapist are you okay with this so how are you doing all right originally originally I'm from Korea I went out with a year old yes almost never ever been to Korea once I love the weather and being by the ocean and the culture has a lot of things to do with the food was a lot to like the traffic it seems like we're having a lot of economic difficulties in the parking tickets or super high sometimes I'm really annoyed by our government I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot fire shoes did he say buy your shoes your shoes aren't showing I have traveled a bit and sort of traveled I haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while oh just it it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here it's exciting and it makes me feel like I'm actually I'm really living cuz sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in LA and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lot of different things that you don't think about everyday well one of my trips I went I went to Singapore and then to Thailand and it was when I was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to he had he was a sales engineer for a systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this is kind of like a company thing so we went to Singapore for a few days and that was really interesting you know of course it's a lot different over there it's not just like going to Canada or something but they had a big reception in the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principles of company which is all fun and after Singapore we did some chores in Singapore this really isn't interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really it's not a lot of crime but the government is very is it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to Thailand and that was almost as really completely different cuz like jungle we went to Phuket little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to Singapore just in a lot of different ways with her and just bring it was nice and everything was very cheap had a massage on the beach for $8 and it was interesting he has an hour for $8 well I'm in school right now and I didn't I didn't finish school and I was younger because and had health problems so here I am I'm I'm just doing my General Ed right now I'm going to SMC yeah I'm happy call my dream job would be to be a veterinarian but I probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily ocelot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and and in a Veterinary capacity I think I'm right on the cusp it depends on the environment and the people I'm with and how comfortable I am but I'm really outgoing when I feel comfortable with people and I'll be really reserved if I'm not well I mean aside from sleeping I like like relaxing things like going for a bike ride on the Strand or if I'm at home I'll just like reading a lot of times I can just lay there and my mind might be doing things but I'm kind of relaxing I really good I don't have I would say there's certain things that they can really like make me like when I see Injustice has or things like that then I mean I can really feel it but I never just likes laugh a handle or throw things or even you know yell show me some arguments I mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument I would say last summer when I think it was after a baseball game there's a group of us and we went to we went to have shabu-shabu after the game and and I think and I know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like she's a good friend in some ways and she's a traffic kind of distant in other way so I don't consider her like someone that I would confide in and you know it was any problems but sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she's got the same sense of humor I do so I think she had said something to me during the night which kind of bother me but you know I just kind of that's just how she is and then I guess I said some things that she spell were I wish he gets really offended easily I think but after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we're friends again but like she never has never confronted me ever had hardest decision it was leaving my ex-boyfriend how did you do well it wasn't it was a long time coming I mean I was thinking about it for like 5 years you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he's a really good guy but we just had a lot of we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so I had thought about it and thought about it and we are already engaged but we've been together for a long time so I don't know I was always is always on my mind like should I get married or should I not and then finally we were just always having we're always went with the word I'm looking for we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and I just decided that I was going to leave and I did it was really hard it was it was the hardest decision of my life and I can say that definitively and but I I think it was for the best who's probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in Nevada and when I when I I really like my job I mean it was it was pretty good it was right over at the beach and when I told him that I was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me in a different position which is awesome and that was really stressful for me because I already promised my friends have to leave I would have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there it was really really stressful and I stress over it for about three weeks until I actually laughed and when I went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah blah when I got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that I needed a certain amount and the other principles of the company where you know it was a hard situation cuz she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange and they were all when I was I was surrounded by Mormons and I don't have anything against Mormons but it was very different because I was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there so I would say that's when it's it's it's it just a pivotal point in my life and I think that I really wish I had just stayed well if you can erase something from my memory then I would probably say memory like really if if I could erase something from my memory what would I want to erase everything can we think of anything I mean even like that that bad decision that I made you know it has value in it so I can't really say that I would want something erasing maybe if I was like raped or something and it was really horrifying then I would but I don't well if your time about being in a deep sleep I'm in a deep sleep a lot but I never feel rested and that's it's a medical problem of mine can you tell me well I always feel like I haven't slept for two days and there are points in in the day I would say during some days are points in the day where I really feel alert and alive and and rested but their short-lived but I sleep a lot I sleep pretty crappy physically pretty crappy no thanks now I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but that's that's usually what doctors like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed I'm I'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but that's the first thing that they try and figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep but I do I do I would say I feel down sometimes my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down I would say that I do feel down sometimes a lot of time but it's not I would say is reasonable considering the situation that I'm in okay I need triggered by something they're just triggered by Tech that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular oh there I mean I mean for a long. Of time or every night I experience happiness like when I go out with friends or I go and you know I've find some great new dish I like I mean what type of Happiness are you looking for well I mean right now my friend just had surgery and so I'm staying with her this week I'm really enjoying it I mean even though we could never live together I can never live with live with her long-term and I'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but I'm having fun and you know she just she installed the Groupon app on her on her phone yesterday cuz she's been paying too much for laser hair removal installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her as a Groupon deal so I mean you know there's a little fun things like that how your best friend are you probably OCD and probably thinks I'm pretty prissy compared to her I think that she would say that have a good heart or very different it probably that I am I should ask her I know we go out so I think she say that I'm fun but she has mentioned that I'm I'm a very private person and that I know I've I knew before she said that why I have what I told you I have I have a lot of problems right now and so I don't really tell people about them it is kind of a kind of a killjoy but also people can feel I feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of it's just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help her they feel guilty but they have busy lives so it's kind of traits of gaap but I would say even before even before this difficult time in my life I've been I put a private person I don't know why I think a lot and I'm a deep thinker and maybe it's a you know it not like I feel like I feel abnormal but maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or not sure well one thing that I regret right now is yeah I haven't really found somebody you got to spend the rest of my life with so I would tell myself to concentrate more on that cuz once you hit 40 it's it's it's a lot harder I would say that I persevered I'm very proud that even though I have a lot of difficulties in my life the fact that I'm a male making this commitment to go to school and I'm doing it on my own and you know it's it's kind of a if people if people knew all the problems today have they be like well you know why are you worried about school but I really feel that you know I'm I'm doing this and I'm really proud that even through everything and getting a raise okay thanks hi,12

446,okay thank you yes I'm wonderful how are you California yes the weather is one of them I have the food and the way I everything is centrally located the traffic the smog and it's just gotten really really overcrowded I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I wouldn't say a lot but I do try to travel at least once once or twice every two years just exploring different things and being able to have different experiences things of that nature and no learning new things and I'm just different cultures that I like to learn about different cultures and when you travel you get a sense of you no feedback from different cultures and different areas so I like that well I just came from Miami I last year I went to Miami for a week and a half it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going and it was wonderful the people are really nice and it was really a great experience I went out there for a particular event they have something every year I'm where everyone comes out from all over and they just kind of party and hang out and meet new people was really fun well from that trip I would say swimming and the beautiful beautiful beautiful Miami Beach Waters was wonderful yeah it was child development well I've always been interested in children since I was younger my baby's had a lot so I had a lot of experience with kids at a young age and As I Grew Older I realize that it was something that I like to do so that's when I am looking to Child Development courses and I thought that it was something like that I wouldn't enjoy doing so I started taking classes and the rest of History I have gas it's been 15 years in August yeah my dream job I would say to become a principal what is something that I thought about doing for a while now and I've actually just began the steps to try to get that going so very back in school and I'm going to be taking courses I'm so that I can make that happen because it is a dream of mine thank you it's going to be pretty difficult there is several years of schooling that I have ahead of me and you know it's definitely going to be a challenge but it's something that I'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that I'm willing to I'm willing to do a little bit of both I think a little bit of both I can be shy at times in and out going as well but I think a little bit of both I would say what do you do I meditate I I'm a big big meditator so I love meditating I love just reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time oh wow I'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper I again series of meditations that I do it involves deep breathing and just really censoring yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat and you can really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot oh wow it was just recently actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and it was about just the way he responds sometimes to me I can be a little aggressive and we're just trying to work with that because I don't respond well to aggression I totally tune out and that's actually would happen so yeah that was it I felt very frustrated and I actually felt angered to but more frustrated and I felt fat and too because I don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions that one time the situation watch I wish I would have handled differently honestly I haven't had a situation like that and 20 years I've pretty much kind of you know kind of mastered more responses to certain stimuli I kind of got that down tell me about the hardest decision I've ever had to make while it was when I was 16 years old and I became a teenage mother I was pregnant at 16 and I had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort and I chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions is not the hardest decisions to make as a 16 year old teenage teenager just whether I wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether I wanted to embark on raising a life when I was just a child myself so that I think was the hardest decision I had to make well I mean my son is almost 19 now so it's 19 years later and I actually am so glad it was one of the best things that I ever did by not choosing to avoid him and chew being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and and I have not regretted the decision that's my only child and I love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and I feel very special to be his mom I do oh yeah I know it's it's not easy it definitely has its difficulties I'm just as anything but at the end of the day it is really rewarding and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become productive citizen and go out in society and start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is oh wow so many ways the first what are the first way is I actually listen to my son and I are accepted feedback even if I don't like it and I allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when I was little there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it and with my son I give him options allow him to express itself allow him to give me feedback or negative or positive because I feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and that's parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of make sure that you nurture that because that's kind of the way that they develop me now and it's really really important so I'm different and I and a lot of ways and that right thank you well it depends sometimes it's it really depends it depends on the time that I go to sleep it depends on the time that I woke up so it's a lot of factors I can't just give you one answer I would say that it varies sometimes I can go to sleep and fall asleep right away and other times I can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep so it varies I've been feeling great lately I've I really have been I can't say that work for the last week didn't affect me you know the argument with my husband but other than that I have been feeling really good no I haven't no I have not you know what honestly I feel happy everyday you know everyday I wake up I'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage Carpe Diem seize the day so I feel blessed every morning I wake up it's a blessing you know because I realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so I feel really really blessed everyday thank you as nurturing patient loving friendly kind of reserved well I wish that I had already completed college and had my Master's Degree and sometimes I wish I was a little bit more knowledgeable and certain subjects and I can change that if I could change anything I would change that those two things and also I would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert you know what no regrets no regrets you live and learn nothing is perfect everything that I've gone through has made me the person that I am today so I wouldn't change anything because I'm happy with the person that I am today oh man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before relationship even before your career I really really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education I'm most proud of where I come from as a Teenage mother being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same I've had my same job for

484,okay yes I'm doing well I was born in Oakland all the different areas of the city the different cultures that are here the traffic the lack of public transportation and the superficiality I I don't I would love to travel more being able to experience a different way of living getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspectives I'm in 2008 I studied abroad in Brazil and that was about four months and I was in Bahia which is in the north and see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a Homestay family I've always wanted to travel and I chose to Brazil because they have an afro Brazilian population or large after Brazilian population which I really want to learn more about and I think their history and their culture is really interesting I think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and figuring out where to go right now I'm getting my masters in social work dream job I think to consult about mental health and how to how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing a research and Consulting work and getting to travel basically that those would be the main characteristics I think that's a false dichotomy but I do consider myself shy but at the same time out going in the sense that I push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and I'm determined to do what it takes to become successful I listen to music and just lay on my bed and I guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which I'm learning more about as well as exercise pretty good I don't get angry a lot so as far as angry temperament I'm pretty good at that what month is this may probably two months ago and I argued via text message so it's not really intense arguing but I guess you called arguing in a sentence over whether or not I should be forgiven for something that I thought was minor with a friend I've had for a few years I felt anxious sad and angry yeah those are the main emotions I know them because I think I'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then I'll notice the physical manifestations of emotions like if if my heart's racing or from getting sweaty if I'm if my breathing is more shallow I'll know I'm anxious so I'll know something is bothering me that I wish I had handled differently I guess related to this argument I went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and I know that it wasn't such a big deal but I wish I hadn't have let myself get to that point it impacted a relationship and I also felt really bad about what I did hardest decision wow probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into I briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards after dropping out I had to really rethink what it is that I wanted to do and what I wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on I think by recognizing what I don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program after think revolving around the same person I've spoke of earlier it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling-out over his treatment of me and involved another person and I wish I could get that out of my mind I have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the Bay Area I didn't grow up with her but I've gotten closer to her as an adult we talked pretty regularly with my dad I grew up with him mostly he lives in Atlanta and we don't talk as much but we are we were pretty soon relationship it's not really that contentious or anyting and I'm an only child so I don't have siblings I don't have a large family I'm so in general I'm not really that close to family one person is my mentor who I met in 2005 and she's a judge and I met her when I was in community college and she really open my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that I would be able to achieve certain things is it for you to get it pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up because usually I do not look forward to what I have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me want to stay in bed all so I wake up pretty tired and not really feeling refreshed I think just self talk about how would I have to do isn't that bad or that the things that I'm doing now or going to end pretty soon with the end of the school year trying to think of things that I can look forward to in the week also listening to music and browsing the internet kind of gets my mind going feeling oh wow feeling emotionally drained in some ways and at the same time feeling like I've accomplished a lot and I've grown so mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time no I haven't yes an 2006 the convergence of a lot of stressful factors I was out of touch with my mom I started why I transfer to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really exacerbated things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where I just felt really overwhelmed yes I do yes I notice I'm better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them I'm able to think differently about things that happen maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas I need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas this past weekend I reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again people have different takes on on me I don't have one best friend but I think people would describe me as very analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual I wish that I did not order it I wish I was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which I'm working on and I wish that I had more energy start going to therapy now but yeah I really would and also to what house am I playing 10 years ago 18 okay so graduating from high school I would tell myself to pick up some more job skills that I wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer idea of what I wanted to do as a career I think the fact that I'm in grad school and coming from the background that I that I come from low socioeconomic status and just pushing through challenges to get here thanks for sharing your thoughts you're welcome bye okay,9
471,okay thank you yes I'm doing well thank you from Los Angeles sports Outdoor Sports mainly surfing snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing awesome awesome traffic yes experiencing different cultures well I love going to Mexico and it's so much different from California and Western culture so to speak I know Mexico's a western civilization but the level of entertainment than the level of education is so much different than they're like two different worlds traveling you mean I would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji and the name is table Aurora and it's a very small island you can walk around in 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes and it's a place where you go to go surfing and it is an incredible visually incredible and experientially incredible place I studied biology I was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also not at all I'm working in areas of business now yes I am my dream job would be to be a missionary yes my father's initial objective when he became an MD was to become a missionary and the he's a very generous person and I think I am too I guess I got that from him hereditarily but I would like to help people and I don't think being a doctor is helping people I really don't I think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources things like that if I could afford to travel to remote places like that screensavers I know it's not what are you my exercise I think I'm pretty good at it. I think I'm pretty effective at it it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her lack of consideration I felt frustrated a situation which I wished I could handle differently in my later years I would say I don't have many regrets in my younger years I used to be snubbed by people and I would keep my mouth shut and I wouldn't say anything I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings I've learned that that is so wrong and so they'll probably the last 15 to 20 years I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that takes care of the anger immediately yes say it depends what you mean by trouble I think all the way around once you take the beginning the beginning to the end it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble going back it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted we argued at length for many months and years about this and finally I prevailed and I didn't go to I didn't go that route but that was probably the most difficult. In my life there was a time when I wished I could erase a female interactions girlfriends than and their betrayals but now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today and and dealing with them defines who I am today oh my parents are deceased I had very good relationships with my parents I'm very thankful for that even though my father was somewhat of a hard handed person we came to an understanding well before he died and my brothers I get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has psychological issues and they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through turmoil well I guess I really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed and he has Suicidal Tendencies and that he's not working he's very highly educated and he really doesn't talk to me and his family is very abusive towards him it's an I'm not a happy relationship for his family yes I know I would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my model he's my archetype for what a man should be use unimpeachably honest and kind yet on the other hand he was he had high expectations of me and my two brothers how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it wants my head hits the pillow I am dead asleep like a log but lately I've been having just last night I couldn't sleep I woke up at 2 and I have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that I received one month ago with my own personal methods of handling stress I'm okay I'm probably 90% okay that 10% comes from a uninsured nurse about the future about whether I will survive this or not not really no never never oh I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking I always experience Joy when I'm exercising at a very high level of exertion funny jovial intelligent perfectionist that's no one's asked me much about that maybe to submerge my hedonistic self I look at it once again and my father feels my Consciousness he was the ultimate dufur of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the self-made man that he was or as I am looking always for the present how I feel now and it's difficult for me to slog through a mile full of crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away it would be my ex-boss and he started using my last day of work when he fired me he started using a lot of profanity toward me and I turned to him and I said you cannot talk to me that way and he continue to use more profanity until I objected to it again and that's when he fired me and that still in my mind and that occurred a year-and-a-half ago anything I regret oh yeah I regret not getting married and having kids you've done anything to a boy sure I suppose I could but I think that that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the United States is not the end of the world it is once you get to trouble you find out that we are not if we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world that other people think that we're the only ones that think that and I disagree that's a good one I would say I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and I think I've done that and I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer so I think I've done I've I'm happy with my life thus far I was giving a rock climbing lesson I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me I would say my Devotion to the environment I wasn't always an environmentalist but I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment because today there are a lot of people people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that and I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment thanks for sharing your thoughts with me and you're welcome goodbye it was interesting okay,0
418,can she see me okay okay okay and please are you okay with this I'm okay I was born in Mississippi when I was 2 and 1/2 years old but actually wasn't me all day was kind of Monica yes never I was only two and a half years old I don't remember everything things you really like about Olay oh I like the beach I love all the restaurants the music thing just a general excitement in the Parks and all that the traffic do maintenance on the streets all the potholes the pollution well I study a number of things at school I studied at one point I was I I had major in public relations journalism specialization journalism then I also studied as a pre-law major and so I studied the law and then I also studied human and Human Services courses mainly because I'm a people person and I enjoy helping people that's great what's your dream job wow dream job my dream job I don't really have one right now okay I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot no I don't and I can't even see your shoes sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver what do you do listen to music watch horror movies I love horror flicks and I have a fish tank tooth I like to watch my fish also like to play tennis when I can I haven't been able to play Lately though because of physical problems can you tell me about that it's just that I had injury drum mic my my ankle because I have anemia and and I got dizzy one night and I fell on my ankle and on my leg and so I'm just waiting for that to really heal but I'm planning on getting back into town this is one of the things I enjoy doing it really relaxes me I really don't have a temper over the years I've learned how to do how to control that probably would have been yesterday but there was no argument and what was it about nothing that I can recall what's something you feel guilty about something I feel guilty about there's nothing right now that I feel guilty about a situation that I wish I had handled differently I really can't think of one right now the hardest decision be absolutely hardest decision that I ever had to make was when my I have twins twin twin boys are grown now I had twins twin teen teenagers and I had lost my job and we were living in a motel and the rent for the motel was outrageous I couldn't no longer continue to pay the cable the type of money that they wanted so I had to briefly put my son under the and in foster care for 4 for a minute that was the hardest decision I had to make schizophrenic and he had had he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training for a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hair when he was 4 years old but and then we turned 14 to schizophrenia came up so right now he he's going to supportive living environment is 27 years old he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now that I had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication to give him the medication and he hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever so but he's come to terms with that and we will all have come to terms with that he's doing he's doing pretty good that son he's 27 to Texas with his wife and he got a promotion to so now he's in California to buffering California okay so that's a very good about that yeah well I've grown children are grown children not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger it was difficult times okay difficult. And is this a good time to but yeah there's some difficult times well the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to Matt was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenia can and they were in temporarily and when was in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia so and I lost track of the question the hardest thing about being a parent at this point this point in my life there is nothing hard about it what's the best thing about being a parent the best thing about being a parent I don't know I guess it's just to see something that you created and developed into a pretty decent human being you know a person smsa oh a lot of ways well actually I didn't have two parents I had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I have no contact with him but the things that I do differently than what my mother did she was a strong disciplinarian both verbally and physically and she had the tendency to see how group has tendency to be very critical critical and opinionated and very religious and swearing for a look at people who were not that was me as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing was that the park the question I don't get a good night sleep I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's that that's all there is to it I don't take medication I don't sleep I'll be up all night I will be up for days if I don't take medication irritable I'm tired well lately you know just a little anxious really you know I just recently made a move to a new apartment has a lot of expenses and new experiences and things like that and I will new furniture and leave this and that that you have to get a managed to do all that but the whole thing was kind of stressful POF no not PTSD we are that was back in I think 2004 because my life has gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or or in something to tell you the truth yes yeah I think it's useful you know what's a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and we'll discuss things that may be bothering you are good things to eat with medication cuz I've been going to therapy the changes a lot of changes I've been more focused more hopeful it is just been a good experience for me which is why I've been saying to go really happy well I can feel really happy by some currents I can't think of anything right now just like that and then I go back to how I was feeling so I can't really pinpoint anything really I mean I mean something comes to me unexpectedly or things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time that makes me happy when things go right how about that something I did recently but I really can I live with somebody that I really enjoyed being really really enjoyed recently I can't think of anything I don't have a best friend my best qualities or that I'm an honest person I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently very generous overly generous and I'm very I like to help other people I mean help them come on a personal level and help people problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody that's helping their mouth anything I regret how so it's only one thing I regret and that is sad after my twins that became old enough to start going to school at the elementary school level I was taking some courses as a pre-law major and at the time I was married to their father turned out not to be a good fit for me and because of the stresses involved with him well knowing that that was running and I was going to leave him I dropped out of college that was my biggest regret stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what but I'm a good person I'm a good human being fo okay goodbye that's going to go go by are you done okay I was weird I was a little weird I was a little nervous,10
474,cool all right cool thanks hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today yes I'm good how are you I was born in Hawaii but I grew up in Colorado yeah yeah how about some 7 to 8 years ago I should go back once it once or twice a year it's how does it compare to La it's it's different it's not as busy there's more things to do outdoors in the mountains on my fan for work yeah I am I love it here it took about a year before I really felt comfortable but once they got through that kind of hard year it was pretty good out here but a good time I love that I can go to the beach I love that it's warm most of the time I love that I've met a lot of people that love the Arts as much as I do the traffic just like everyone else yeah yeah this traffic and it's pretty much just traffic earthquakes not as much as I'd like it's just nice to go someplace new experience something different I want to hear that I went to Alaska couple years ago and that was really awesome I got to go fishing in the ocean and I got seasick that was an awesome but it was cool I saw a bear in real life a bear walk through a yard is really different than La was way cool English creative writing well I always wanted to tell stories so it just made sense to work on riding and somehow some aspect yeah I am to have my own TV show where I write it and everyone watches it every week and it's awesome really hard cuz there's a lot of people that have the same dream so yeah more outgoing than shy I like talking to people enjoy other people take screensaver go to the movies or turn on music dance pretty good I was at work couple about a month ago about a month ago I got mad at someone because I didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions and so when I try to have a conversation about it they got mad and then I got mad and we got mad I felt like I wasn't being heard or listen to and felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so because we couldn't have a dialogue I felt like no one was listening to me totally no ragrets I yes I don't know if there is one I mean I'm sure there is but one time I was driving behind someone and they will they cut me off and I think it's just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago it's just one of those days where I just didn't want or I just been a frustrating day when this person cut me off and I almost got an accident with them I just followed them to their parking spot and actually I'd haunted them and they they flipped me off and so she's really really going to my skin would cut me off and almost caused an accident and then and then flipped me off so I followed them to the spa and I asked said Miss why did you put me off when you cut me off and and she said oh you know I'm I've had a rough day I don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and I told her well you're not releasing a very good example for your daughter and you know I didn't need to be Petty like that but I just I wanted to be a guess tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to get you going deep is the hardest decision was coming out to my mom telling her I was gay I mean it wasn't hard cuz it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom is very conservative and she she had trouble accepting and it it took a while but when she did you know everything is better and I knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she don't want to hear when I was little kid my my grandfather found our dog run over in there on the road and he and brought it in and buy them over as a kid just like seeing death like that really just threw me off and frighten me and I was just one of those moments but like I guess I wish I hadn't been there for it because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and she was woman's I guess you need as a kid but I didn't really want to experience like losses like that in your face our relationship and our family is pretty good we find out as close as most but we do know we was we don't talk often but we talked with love and we always love each other when we see each other my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to you know pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down so glad I had her how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it's easy sometimes it's not wife in between jobs recently I start a new job next week but while I've been off I haven't been working I tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and I'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and getting up at like 11 so I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or 12:30 and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half and I should be I should I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like 9 but I want to stay up I guess a little scatterbrained like today I'm a little scatterbrained cuz I I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and so scatterbrained most of the had a lot of time on my hands like I don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working I guess but yeah I think that's the question I just thought maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the the not working thing no a couple days ago when I got my new job I got hired outgoing listening attentive fun loyal Bank help I wish that I I probably should have looked better I wish I had more hair up here losing a little bit if I wish I was a little skinnier this is girdles pretty tight and you know sometimes I wish I had more money but nothing too drastic I'm okay yeah hoo when I was a little kid I was I was the fly was the fat kid and remember I was like I was going to high school and it was like the second day and I remember this guy came up to me and was like he was like pretty nice to me I thought midnight realize he'd like this like out of a movie right here put Band-Aids on my back that's it like I'm a fat cow until like like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and I didn't know I walked around with it for like half an hour people laughing I didn't get it and then find this girl is going to me and was like hey there's like Band-Aids on your back that's Kelly's mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take them off and I remember like I couldn't get them I was trying to find him and then I just never liked putting my head in my locker and like I didn't want anyone to see me cry so I just like what made out of my locker and like pretend like I was looking at stuff my backpack but really I was going to know the crying fat kid who can get the mean stickers off his back anyting probably yeah you know I would I would try to keep trying to let myself know 2 to look at things positively and not like we would have people think about you and I spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as I got older I didn't care as much and I start enjoying life a lot more so I went to Coachella it's a music festival it was 3 days with all of my friends and my boyfriend and we we danced and me went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time oh I guess my MyCareer humble as it may be I really stuck in La a long time when it was when like it was hard I stay I stuck around it and quit so and I'm proud that I've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood thanks for sharing my pleasure bye bye that was fun okay,4
477,okay sounds good thanks yes thanks I am well thank you how are you I grew up in Oklahoma I moved La about five and a half years ago so I used to be on the wet on the east coast and then I decided I wanted to come out here my hometown not very often most of my families moved away so I visit them but I don't actually get back to Oklahoma March Oklahoma's very different Ellie is a lot more exciting there's a lot more to do here and the ocean obviously is very nice you know that's a good question I I wanted to try something new and I've always loved the beach and I thought I also like big cities so I thought La might be a good place for me to come very it's probably one of the best decisions I ever made Kizi I think it seems kind of natural that seems like a good fit I just really like it here that's great I have a couple of roommates and we get along really well I live a couple of blocks from the beach and every day I get to walk on the beach or you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice I studied philosophy and political theory in government and did a little bit of English literature on the side it kind of just happened naturally I think I went to a liberal arts school and got kind of exposure to a lot of different areas and I just followed what I liked was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that not exactly I work for an educational non-profit so I work with grad with graduate students in the social sciences and Humanities but I don't actually use my philosophy background very often you know I haven't actually study to become a success coach and so I working with students has is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but I'd really like to work with with other people so I'm not just students but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams hey it it's fairly hard I'm in the sense that you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but it's also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so I'm finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult to I'm definitely on the Shire side I'm an introvert so I'm pretty good in one-on-one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people I very much an observer so I tend to listen a lot and I'm not as engaged and I think that is something that goes it is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted so I bet say and it's also challenge 10 not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers pretty good I think but I do have a temper so I can get I can get upside from time to time really it can be a challenge when I'm driving but other than that no I'm not sure it would have probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would have been a friendly argument probably with one of my liberal friends so but I actually can't remember the specific time I meditate I do that almost every day I also walk at the beach I love the ocean and I really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful and I like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so that's nice well let me think about that for a minute having a hard time coming up with anything I mean I'm sure there are plenty of things just nothing comes to mind okay I'm sorry well this isn't exactly an event it's with the dream and it's not a particularly traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but I do have it sometimes probably more often than I like so I wouldn't be upset if it even if I didn't have it and it's just a version of a dream that I think a lot of people probably have but it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know I'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why did my studying attend class the way I should have which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now I have the stream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating and I'm not exactly sure why I mean I know why but I don't know what it applies to because it's not like I am worried consciously at least about failing things so no I don't think so at least not not that I'm aware of I feel guilty I have a brother and a sister in law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and I love my nephew he's 8 he's adorable and I when I used to live there when he was younger I spent a lot of time with them and since I've been in California and particularly in the last year I spent a lot less time visiting them so for example I saw them for week of Christmas and then I went back and I think beginning of May so it was you know for months between the the last time I'd seen them and that I felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when I leave and he asked when am I coming back so that some that makes me feel bad sometimes well I have a brother I'm very close to him he's younger and he's like for four and a half years younger he's married I have a nephew my both my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them with most of them on my father's side there's one brother and he's married and has if you could drive to cousins on that side then on my mother's side there are 545 other kids most of them with several children of their own so I have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook and they're a couple that I talk to you on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so say it well I have a lot of friends I think that have been positive influences when I came out to California and I started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place is very different from what I was used to it was a little bit challenging and she also work there so we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of I would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she's moved to Vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we're going to Napa this weekend so that should be good but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when I came out here to really know anybody in a know since I'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends is really nice because we share a lot of same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know I think she kind of gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice how is your day I'm a sleeper so it's pretty easy sometimes my you know depending on how long I've been awake I can be without a little wound up and somehow got to take a little while to decompress but I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that's very helpful and I can sleep I generally sleep in 90-minute Cycles so usually six or seven and a half hours but I can easily sleep 9 hours if I have the time and inclination I usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if I do I don't remember it so well I actually don't sleep very well when I travels one of the things I do for work is I travel quite a bit because I work for a company that's back East so I work from home most of the time but then I travel like one week a month and when I travel I'll take the red-eye and then I'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so I don't sleep that much it's not that I sleep poorly or badly it's just that I don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay usually the second day it's not very good sounds like a lot more tired and it's harder to concentrate and I don't know it just feels like more of a struggle good summerisle is an is a busy time for the organization that I work for so I'm a little I don't know stressed is the right word but you know a little anxious about everything going well this summer but in general I'm feeling pretty good really I can't I can't do anything there is one thing I am I do struggle with exercise like I like to walk a lot and I hike with friends and I have been really motivated about it for a couple of months but then I went away to the east coast when I came back I was a lot less motivated cuz I didn't really exercise when I was there and I gotten out of the Habit even though it only been about ten days and so now I'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as I would like it's okay thank you now now well he's a lot of fun and he really likes me and I really like him and we play a lot of games and talked a lot and actually doing a book club now so we're going to Skype and may God is more time with him that way but just being around him is fun well she probably say that I know how to have fun but that I can be serious and that I care about others and that I'm loyal and I'm not sure what else I think those those are probably the main things I wish I had more self-discipline so I wish that you know I could die it or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because I love to eat sugar I wish that I would not procrastinate because I've gotten a lot better about that but I still do and I can be challenging and I wish that I I don't know I wish that I was in a relationship so probably those things so the last organization I used to work at I had a boss and she was I don't feel like she was I don't think we were very compatible and she used to push my buttons or so I thought and so a one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question if she didn't have the answer and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was but it wasn't I I've been a manager for many years and I have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate I thought I meant she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel incompetent or at least that's the way that I felt about it and I did you know I tried to be very calm and said that I would take care of it and I did take care of it but after that our relationship wasn't really the same and I ended up leaving there to go back to the old organization that I work for not that long afterwards because I just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interactions so I heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing and then I thought it's really profound and I wish that I had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here's this beautiful coat it's $100 I want it I'm going to buy it I don't think of it is costing $100 think of it is costing 10 times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have 10 times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and I think I've been much more consumer than a saber and so I wish that I had to been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago probably they asked me to be his god parent and his Guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because of it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that I was a good person the kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so let's see well it wasn't really recently but in

retired and I'm waiting on my SSDI right now what's your dream job what's your question you consider yourself more shy or shy tell me about family oh wow I came from a dysfunctional family I really don't have many Family Values me and my brother 13 years apart in age so I really don't know my brother that well so I really don't know much of a family life we never sat down at the table together and had meals together it was always like separate times when we come in and eat another one would come in and eat we never sat down at the same table so I don't know much about family life I listen to music and I listen to relaxing relaxation music like Chimes a brook water running stuff like that how are you I'm on medication right now I get aggravated really easily mood swings personality disorder but sometimes it just flares up depending on the situation of somebody gets in my face but I try not to let it happen cuz I know the circumstances when was the last time you argue with them Wheels on the Bus I was sitting in the back on the bus and the guy came back and he wanted me to move for he could sit down but I'm a big guy and he's a big guy so I decided just to get up and let him have a seat I didn't want to get no confrontation I just let it go that had to be meeting a girl that I've known for 18 years she's had two children with this guy and now the guys going to be part of the family and I feel very comfortable about that but I still have feelings for this girl but I know that the father of the boys but not married he's going to be involved with the family and I I don't like that what's something you feel guilty about that's a good one back in 2010 I went back from my mom's funeral and my brother was hard up for money and he took his Ira out and spend it and I have promised him I was going to pay him back I wasn't able to pay him back and he held it against me so I felt guilty about that because I made a promise and I didn't keep it but there was more circumstances into that and he doesn't understand he didn't write to me he didn't call me he didn't do a lot of things tell me about the hardest decision the hardest decision I ever had to make was when I was with the merchant marines I was very comfortable being at sea and my wife at the time she wanted me to stop sailing and just get a regular nine-to-five job where I would have been very comfortable staying at Sea and working on ships cuz I love that that was what I loved but she didn't like that so she'd rather me work 9 to 5 tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory dead bodies I always see a lot of dead bodies I had circumstances in the military where I recovered a dead body in the Philippines a boy had jumped ship and we recovered the body underneath the pier and I had to pull the body out and put it in a body bag and another incident was in boot camp there was a circumstances were me and this guy got letters all the time from our girls but he was engaged and he committed suicide because the girl dumped him for another guy and a crush them and he end up jumping 3 ft in front of me while I was in Barracks Duty and I seen his head explode like pumpkin and it affected me greatly I see that all the time have you ever served in the middle yes I was in the Navy 15 years into with the merchant marines 24 family thing my father was in the Navy my cousin's was in the Air Force my other uncle was in Marine Corps I just wanted to serve my country are you happy you did that yes I love my country USA serve in the military no ragrets I know but we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf we had the weapons pointing at us while we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf but I never saw combat was never in the combat situation never had a fire a gun at somebody so I don't know what it was like what I'm traveling through is going through is non combat PTSD which means I was in a combat zone at first it was hard I was collecting unemployment for 18 months then after the unemployment ran out I had to get a job so I got various jobs working security and refineries and I tried to stay busy the best I could it was okay I worked refineries I worked security I worked for wineries security guard for wineries I did a little odds and ends I was able to get a full-time job and that was with the merchant marines I went to the Coast Guard and apply for set g m e d I forgot but anyway I worked for engineering how did serving in the military change you made me a better person I was in a scared when I first joined I was kind of scared but then we join the military and made me a lot tougher and stronger I stood up for my own grounds I wasn't being pushed around and I just like people applauding when you would walk into a place and they would appreciate what you did for your country made it all worthwhile depressed mood swings high anxiety isolation I have no social life I don't have much of a communication with women I don't know how to act around them so I'd like to say to myself have you noticed any changes getting out more before I was always staying in my room but now I'm making the effort to go out to see things I go to movies I go out for dinner by myself so my behavior has changed somewhat I'm not staying in like I used to know not have insomnia I see dead bodies I'm on risperidone and trapezoid with supposedly help me sleep but sometimes I only get like three hours sleep I'm up half the night I don't sleep too well what was the question have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD yes non combat PTSD it has because of circumstances that happened trauma while I was in the Navy and I'm going through group sessions now on Wednesday I sit in classes and we talked about it in fact August 28th I graduate from my class and get a certificate so that's a good thing about it how long is it a year ago cold sweats nightmares insomnia just jittery always looking over my shoulder I don't feel comfortable around people don't trust people I need triggered by something no I like to change can we change the subject you're persistent what brought me to seek help brought me to seek help was I got tired of nightmares I got tired of staying up guitar being jittery Got Talent with cold sweats I just get tired of all those things being antsy and jittery and just you know it just didn't feel comfortable yes every Wednesday 3 or 3 to 4 yes I do I understand some things I didn't understand before and as a group or six of us in the group and we help each other we give advice to each other and it works out pretty well can you tell me if well we got Marines Navy Army and Airforce and what we do we share experiences of what we experienced right now we're going through a lot of problems with our daughters and relationships with the daughters that a lot of times we don't feel comfortable with our daughters because some way or another we have done either harm to them or something we haven't worked with them or worked out with them and now we're trying to build that relationship up what sort of changes kind of changes amor happy I never really been happy Ali I I just live day today one day at a time has really been much happiness in my life I'm going through a lot of ups and downs and disappointments and it's been hard for me I've slept in homeless shelters and slept and garages and closets so I really haven't had a a kind life you know positive influence in your life influence in my life my my psychologist he's been good for me to Morrissey and my counselor I have in PTSD it's been good for me also I also have a friend over at the it's been a real good friend from my we talked a lot and I think we're good for each other we both suffer through the same thing

tell you more about that when I come back from Philadelphia a woman Lonely in 58 years old looking for some companionship but I'm afraid to go out there and ask cuz I don't know how to act or I don't know what to say to the woman plus being on medication I don't know how she's going to act on that you know sometimes I over medicate myself when I take my medication so I'm not that good of a person to be around you know I sleep a lot thanks for sharing your thoughts you're welcome goodbye goodbye okay yeah and then you can take off a,22
467,yeah I'm okay with it I feel pretty good little nervous because I've never done anything like this before that's why from Ohio Cincinnati two months ago two and a half months I was just looking for wanted to be in a new environment oh yeah I'm ecstatic very happy I took a few weeks just to get adjusted cuz I don't know it the weather is probably the best thing yeah I know been other than that pretty much the same as everywhere else I've been it's nothing I don't really like about la since you know the weather is the best part of it I like to travel somewhat I haven't travelled a lot of my life but over the past year-and-a-half I've done done quite a bit of traveling seeing different places different people new people new faces new places but she lasts will last summer I spent the summer in Cleveland doing the urban farming in the city I stayed at a hospital the first hospital in Cleveland and I was at doing program with the and it was basically we would go to different Urban Farms throughout the city and volunteer about 20 25 hours a week oh yeah really a spur-of-the-moment type of thing wanted to try something different something I've never done before and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try cuz of a you know cuz of a certain stigma that comes along with it and you know I just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that what in the urban farming or in general Urban farming how do I guess I don't know just just the overall experience is going you know eating and going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just send the difference in you know how fresh natural food tasted you know as opposed to the foodie by the grocery store yeah it is really this I was I took two semesters of a college and I was undecided so I was just taking General classes my dream job it's my dream job with the D anything that involves I don't know how like a specific dream job or anything that involves nature just being outside I would like to I wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that as long as I have you know yeah consider myself more shy don't like don't know why it's just the way it is I read listen to music a draw watch movies stuff like that I think I'm pretty good at it I think yeah wow yeah I can't remember the last time I hear argument with someone I don't know again I don't know because I don't dwell on things that happened in the past maybe whether or not to come to California I guess that was a hard decision well I don't know I've been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time and I guess hardest part of the decision was thinking weather whether or not I will be secure or not you know what I mean just going to a new place we don't know anyone kind of are you really don't know what's going to happen so there was a lot of you know fear not in that decision should I go to a place where I don't know anyone I don't I'm not familiar with the area you know only only perception of a hat that I have of this area's you know what I've seen on it and media media and TV so you know yeah I guess that was the hardest hardest decision that I can think of I guess so nothing absolutely nothing yeah nothing I don't feel guilty about anything relationship with my family I'm not really close to my family I guess the person I'm closest to as my mom but you know I don't you know I never really talked to her much I don't really know my dad that well so you know guess my grandmother yeah she yes she's she's very how should I say it she's very to The Thinker I put it like that like she's very insightful so you look so her for a lot of advice because she's been through a lot through a lot in her life I feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot so let you know she's a very positive influence very easy maybe unsure I would say because right now I really don't know what direction I want to go in with my life and it's been a lot of confusion with that but you know it's not it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind felt feels like somehow maybe I'm running out of time I know that's not like that's not it that's not a realistic thought because I don't see how you could ever run out of time but yeah I guess yeah just general not knowing what I want but I know like how do I cope with that how do I cope with that I don't know I just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul-searching it's not hard I mean I mean it's like I can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that I feel like it's necessary and you know certain things in life you just you're forced to face so it's harder to I think it's harder to avoid those type of things no no no today when I talk when I talk to my friend earlier awesome how would my best friend describe me I guess you would say I'm quiet if you describe me as a nice guy insightful Goofy no I don't really think like that no 10 or 20 years ago I guess I will tell myself to stick with whip what stick with what I love did a acting Workshop and numb I don't know if I've always been interested mine and I decided why not no try it so you like it what am I most proud of like an event or an accomplishment cuz I pride myself on being independent bye,0
470,okay chat look like straight up there or are look at the screen okay okay alright okay thank you yes I'm doing okay I'm from Los Angeles California the food the weather in the people I don't know it's not too many things I really don't like about La maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in LA I'm sure you can no not too much I only been like to Texas Las Vegas and that's pretty much it catching a airplane to Houston Texas like back and forth to visit my dad and going to Las Vegas that are oh yeah well when I was younger I used to go visit my daddy cuz he used to live in Houston Texas and I used to catch the airplane a lot and that was a lot of fun I wasn't scared that was a lot of fun and I enjoyed that when I went to school I study Child Development and nursing I know I wanted to be somebody and when I went to school I wasn't sure what I wanted to be so I kind of took nursing the LVN program first and then I didn't want to be a nurse so I changed my major to Child Development and I graduated from that no I'm actually looking for work I'm unemployed right now my dream job will be probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business in my mind is simple but like in reality it seem like it's kind of difficult sometimes I'm shy but I'm really an outgoing person I'm a people person to relax I listen to some slow music. Kind of like have a quiet environment and maybe lay down and watch a little TV or something I'm very good at controlling my temper I don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where I'm going to hurt somebody when I really have arguments there like because people don't agree to disagree and if it's like really Petty it's like we might say it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that just stupid I don't even remember when you feel guilty about probably not working right now I need a job yes maybe I don't really remember a situation I've tried to really think before I really handle a situation and I try to handle it in a my best positive way before I really do something I regret being with somebody like a guy you know if I want to continue a relationship with them or just be single my relationship with my family I don't have I just really stay with my dad and I have a daughter and we just stay close all my family there either in Houston Texas or they're around but I don't really socialized with a lot of my family my dad because I live with him right now I've been staying with him maybe about 5 to 6 years and he's just the only one I really look up to I don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and that's it she's in a fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the 6th grade and I'm kind of excited for that you find it easy to be a parent sometimes is easy but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent it's just you always have to have somebody to bring you Joy I enjoy always doing things with my daughter is just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always is brings me so much joy being a parent well my parents when I was younger they lived apart so my mom I don't know I'm I'm a much better parent cuz I'm more interested about what my child wants to do I'm involved in her life her every step just I'm really fully in my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just at the mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids so it was just my parents and their drug addiction I wish I could erase that from my memory now I cope with them well but when I was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know I just I didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything is just was like I was in the world by myself yeah all is very easy asleep will every night I couldn't sleep anytime I sleep very well a little sad but most of the time I'm very happy I'm just not happy with where I am in my life right now not really I really I try to think very positive and try to do whatever I can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused no I haven't no I haven't the last time I feel very happy was when I graduated from college I feel very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time I was really really very happy like that I feel like I was on top of the world I feel like just overwhelmed with joy just everything was just so exciting for me that day I was just very very happy nothing can make me upset that day I was very happy and when I think about that day it is it's a very happy experience for me right now I don't really have a best friend I really tried to I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of Positive Choices so right now I'm just like I really don't have any friends right now my personality I'm a happy person I'm an outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother insecurities like sometimes I feel like I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something I feel like I can't get through something I can't get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes well I did have a friend and she was like bipolar and I tried to really be your friend no matter the disease she had but she was in a really good friend because she one day she start this being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely yeah just being friends with turn people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't it just when I notice things about people that should determine whether I want to be there friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they my smoke cigarettes or drink and I should notice that that's a red flag and I shouldn't be these people friends to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track well I went to a friend's house that I haven't seen since childhood and they is it a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and I really enjoyed seeing my old friends that are then seeing a long time and just being with my family and certain friends I really enjoyed because I'm really always in the house I really don't go out that often so just I enjoyed being with a group of friends and family and having a good time yeah I'm proud that I did get my GED I did graduate and I do want to be somebody and I'm very proud that I want to be a better parent than my parents thanks for sharing thank you goodbye okay,3

399,okay move this I'm gonna move this behind your arm if you don't hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today created to talk to people in the states I'm not a saint are you okay yes pretty good as far as my parents Ethiopia yes the beaches warm weather the diverse environment traffic well I'm currently in school I'm studying African studies how did you decide I've always been interested in African studies actually was wanted to help people and I figure that I can help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa making influence kind of in-between I have my shy moments but then when I'm around a group of people that Angela I'm pretty outgoing hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the interacts I normally write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play My Guitar pretty good I don't really get angry or anything like that I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing when was the I actually can't remember the last time I argue with someone okay what's something you feel guilty about all the people I've hurt in the past can you tell me about well I've like cheated on people hurt their feelings intentionally some things I should have done that I regret now well with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now and I probably shouldn't have argue so much as try to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out hardest decision I've ever had to make was man I really don't know actually having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it's just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don't want to be there cuz he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just saying I'm stuck in bed and was just terrible tell me about your relationship with your me and my family are very close we don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it but we've never had that closed collection connection especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to a racial mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of Step each other each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does it kind of awkward but it's okay I think they are out of control I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it I feel like they're being applauded by the media there being applauded by celebrities that they follow and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights I fall asleep like a baby what are you like when you don't say usually creative actually when I can't sleep I'll just stay up and I'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up stuff like that is usually a good thing when I can't sleeps nothing really bad cuz I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that I'm lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm at a Giants and I'm alive and then some some days where I'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking not like my life self I don't know his wife's been like that weighs have those UPS in those downs but they kind of balance each other out no the last time I felt really happy was today I'm just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day I went to see you some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers wrote A good essay so pretty accomplished and I feel like my days just a good day my best friend would describe me as odd most people would describe me as odd I see a lot of odd things I do odd things I'm interested in things that most people aren't Just Like Old literature revolutionary stuff stuff about changing the world but through underground means no I don't I don't live a life of regret I never let fear stop you from doing anything tell me how you spend your ideal weekend I'm reading just hang out with some friends driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure things you wish you could change about your I don't wish I could change anything about myself I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be tell me about a time when someone made me feel really bad this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people have hurt her the ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all my parents can you tell me about I mean although we don't see eye-to-eye the always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day although I never listen to him or I don't choose to listen to him once it happens I learned from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learn to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do no more than me I'm not so much anymore I travel around the LA try to find you sights to see but as far as I don't travel outside I'm discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the Limitless possibilities I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself a few days ago I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert has to offer and it was just enjoyable I felt free away from all this the city's needs buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the

416,never had that doesn't matter okay start a conversation okay go back over here when she said she'll let you know hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment and please are you okay sure I'm doing good how are you Chicago yeah about 25 years ago yeah it's been a while actually haven't been back I like Ally I like la it's a big city so it's kind of similar but the weather is not the same so got to let la for the weather family I was a child you took a little adjustment but not hard the weather can't think of anything right off the bat but I sure wouldn't want to leave so my family is here so that's another reason why I wouldn't want to leave traffic not really but I've tried to shove a little bit yeah seeing new places different people the way they live their lives my went to Monterey California earlier the middle of last year that was very nice it's a good question I'm not really sure probably I can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think it's kind of weird but astronomy yeah it was I don't know just kind of fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and I just went down that path no there is not much job opportunities it's kind of limited yeah it does my dream job I would like to own a restaurant a nice butt bar restaurant can you tell me about I'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to released in the area that I live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know tracks of crowd but it's probably cost Lisa I don't know if it's really possible I'm definitely more shy but I can be outgoing when I'm comfortable with people that initially I'm pretty shy good idea a lot of times I try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book that is just takes your mind away relax I've gotten much better at it I used to have problems with that when I was younger but I'm good I'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you think before you speak that type of thing when was the my ex girlfriend when we broke up about 3 months ago we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument that it was it was an argument so that's all I can think of and I haven't really seen her since so that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who drowned separate frustrated like I guess everybody kind of sees things in their own way and do you know my way in my perspective is right and I'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you love your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kind of looking out for themselves oh yeah that's a good example right there with the with my girlfriend I didn't have to I could have reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion there's been times in my life where I got into arguments with friends or something like that were you know or previous relationships where I probably shouldn't have reacted the way I did you know not that I did anything bad but just more of a you know be more mature about not you know reveal your emotions so much for that type of thing tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when I was 18 is it a long time ago I went to school in San Diego and I immediately wanted to come back so I kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and I wish I didn't do that what's something you feel guilty about I feel like I can contribute more to my family and my friends like I think I could do better I think I sell myself short so employment opportunities are hard to come by but if I can find a good job and be a lot more happy because I can provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me yeah real difficult tell me about your relationship with good very good we're pretty open with each other and I see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's good relation I mean we get along very well could be Demi is not perfect but it's good pretty easy I'm a good sleeper I'm probably irritable or harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strained or something because you don't have as much energy and how did the feeling lately good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well have you ever been tag guns with p no not at all never really really heavy and you we all feel happy everyday at some point but really happy probably been a while if I like Super Bowl Sunday I was with all my friends were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when I was really really happy I wish I was more I guess stuff to my goals and I wish I had better drive to succeed I don't know I usually settle for less I don't know I guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad don't really matter I kind of live in the moment and then you kind of realize that 5-10 years ago on by and should have done something I'm just going to stick to that argument with my girlfriend three months ago she made me feel pretty bad tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory I don't know when I was when I was in high school I got into an argument with a friend and I drove my car too fast and it was an area that I didn't know and I hit a turn that I didn't know I was coming and I crashed my car so I wish I didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now stupid immature my parents some of my close friends I have I have a good group of three or four friends they've been positive influences caring guy nice person good heart little little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to make himself better and passionate I guess passionate in a good amp I care a lot and it's the same time sometimes it gets the best of me can you give me the sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated so that's an example yeah probably but I can't think of anything off the top of my head focus more in school because while you're young you have the ability to multitask and something you did recently I don't know really enjoyed I mean I do things everyday that I enjoy but really enjoyed I don't know I cleaned up a bunch of stuff in my room so it's nice to shed some old garbage so that that was all right but don't know if I really enjoyed that I feel content after it what are you most proud of in your life how much it's makes kind of sad I don't know I think I could do better I feel like I'm Underachievers so I don't much I don't know I'm very detail-oriented organized I like to finish tasks I care a lot and I'm very caring I have good intentions in mind I don't like the wrong people I don't like to lie because once you buy one lie leads to another so I don't like that but yeah that's that's about it cool right on have a good day hey those weird I felt like I was in therapy so take this offer,3
455,glass is pretty fashionable so just give her a couple seconds and then she'll start okay hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today yes very well Ohio finish school came out to start my life not often now not really often all because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home prayer I've just really not a comparison you know this is warm and sunny and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment I it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but after I was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here I love the weather I love the fact that I have the ocean and the mountains and so many things that I can choose from and the diversity that I find here can to not have things that I don't like because where I am I know that I'm finding myself there so and I like me so that means there's really nothing I don't like yes I do I love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between all types of people it's a very rich experience which one to wear I guess I'm thinking about Egypt and the wonderful experiences that I have their as I go the people and the warm and loving experience I have the knowledge I get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids excetera things like that there are so many there really are but I can think of seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stay with me how similar we actually all our that's probably one of the things that I remember most from one of my very first trips are there and let's see just the interaction of the people food you know incredible I love the food to nice wow I study lots of different things that studied law I studied entertainment I studied Communications I've studied whatever I want to quite a Renaissance woman it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that I enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and just allows me to be able to be fully developed as a human being being able to do that I don't have a dream job per se what I do have is a desired or just be able to be free to do whatever it is that I choose on a daily basis so probably more outgoing well I start my day out there relax because I start my day with meditation and several other spiritual practices that I performed before I move around I get exercise so that I keep everything humming everything moving and then move forward from there excellent. I don't really have one anymore argued cannot remember the last time that I actually had an argument channel is about I imagine the last time I argue about something probably might be related to money situation I wish I had handled differently you know I try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to Hope guilt about the way anything went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences that I get to explore who I am through so I don't really see them as needing them to be different I need to learn from them or to just really accept what is hardest decision I've ever had to make don't really have a hard decision you know because I grew up and away where my mother was extremely wonderful and the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so for me this is don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because I've been making them since childhood I don't really have a most difficult decision I've ever made event that I could erase from my memory I don't really have one that I can think of that would be so terrible that I would need to erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase how is your day a very easy soon as I hit the pillow I'm out great a little more Physical exertion then normal but still great no not overall but again I attributed that knife credit that to the spiritual practices that I perform on a daily basis they keep me pretty even-tempered no no that's pretty much every day I feel really happy everyday I'm thankful I'm grateful for my life and I'm just thankful for everything that comes into very smart very loving very intelligent funny outgoing I probably probably what my friends would say there's really nothing that I think I need to do to do or to have her to be different about myself like I'm okay with everything the way it is really am what advice would have given myself 10 or 20 years ago to know to understand that everything that happened 10 or 20 years ago was important in terms of developing the person that I am now and so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up recently really enjoyed I cooked a very wonderful meal cuz I love cooking something I really enjoy wow my my willingness to get to know myself through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application of everything that I learned about people cultures places and most importantly you know the God within me bye she breathes I see,1

Embarrassing moment but no change the entire situation or something so I don't want to cross that boundary I just kind of if if so like right there in my face but yeah I'm not looking at it and it's frustrating okay have you noticed any changes in your behavior not since since yesterday I'm pretty consistent no it's been pretty consistent I don't fall asleep I don't wake you up late what are you like crocodile sleep during the day learn more depressed a little more negative not angry negative sorrow night not so not so negative 2 * Hey Big Bird kind of negative yeah how long ago were from the psychiatrist maybe a few weeks ago I want to Snappy Ivan I I turn it into jokes arai tour so I meditate I forgot that I've been so sorry.

Thank you for the try not to be grumpy or anytime just probably filled up at night I feel okay now changes like what well I actually am I hopeful future ICU I see a lot of new things unfolding I mean from that perspective yes nope never I feel okay now I went to Great parties last week that was really cool well it was like on a rooftop and a lot to really are nice people who are basically in the same kind of a mindset are pursuing the same type of goals I know it was all quite inspiring actually I got a lot of information I know a lot of good connections were made awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome party weekend is a cooking my own food relaxing you know I know if I'm in the mood for company yeah I have friends in family members join me well I kind of like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work are you like crazy and nothing happened well you know I charging people in general sometime Miss Mystery do you know if you kind of like her if you look different now you're in a different type of a different set of things make you excited or you're into a different way of thinking people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but yeah I'm kind of figured it out and I'm pretty much over that you know so I see it as their loss not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know that's hey maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me I'm kind of work those things out in time you know yeah are my best qualities Pocoyo listening I think Honda maybe just talkin you know how the conversational level sometimes people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that but you know I guess it is that's probably why it seems I come to the tough so when I when I see too much of that I just saw pull back go for your dream believe me what you're doing don't let anyone discourage you and you'll be okay and that's the way I feel now that it's kind of evolved itself postpartum I think my alarm my my my kind of spiritual relationship you know I might Mike my settlements about not being too too anxious about but things are going around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen and you shouldn't really eat never lies have to be defeated I'm proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my my my thinking my friend work. I think I'd save me a lot of problems that could have been differently anger questions bye-bye,1

Near holiday I felt absolutely fantastic I felt happy I felt relaxed I felt like I didn't have a care in the world to temporarily free what are some things you wish you could change about you I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive definitely more assertive I would say I'm a wonderful wonderful friend when I left somebody you know I love them very deeply friends family boyfriend so I think that's good I'm very loyal as a friend I'm honest I care about people I'm fun to be with so I think those are some of my best qualities my relationship with my family with my father is not so great my parents were divorced when I was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever mostly out so that it's not fantastic but but it's something that I'm used to so it's not as painful as it would be a Patty been there and then I lost him but it's it's still it's still it's still not the best situation I mean I still wish that could be remedied some there's good and bad relationships in my family who's some of the positive influence in your life someone that's been there for me since I was very very young and is always been just incredible when I love her so much what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago 10 or 20 years ago I would have told myself to work harder than and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now a guy regret exactly that I regret I'm not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been it's been much harder tell me about something you did read I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy that was probably a great time I'm one of the best times in the last few weeks and and they're they're great kids you find it easy to be a parent no I think they're there it's challenging it is more difficult because their stepchildren so there are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved but we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but but I but it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it what are some ways that your and your pet I made it make a make a conscious effort not to not to punish them or over punish them I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was scream. I was screaming a lot as a child and it was really it was really difficult so I make sure not to do that what are you most proud of in your life I think I'm most proud of the fact that I have been able to travel the world and live in other places many many other places around the country and around the world and the fact that I learned several languages and that's what I've been able to maintain really long long long relationships with my friends thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you goodbye post survey for you to fill out,7
608,today at 1 so you're going to see everybody okay yes I'm so young I'm second San Bernardino California the weather is nice will still like about La it's very sunny I like the people here I don't like how it's spread out it is and how long was that I don't like the the lack of public transportation and I don't like that everything shuts down at 2 a.m. introverts yes I do why because I tend to be very stoic I don't tend to I don't know express myself so much and I tend to be very reserved and not really forthcoming about my feelings Etc I'm not sure I understand the question exactly but I can't really say I just I just Retreat Within Myself and I don't tend to express what I'm thinking or feeling that makes sense I'm second second place what the whipping what do I do when I'm alone bicycle locks yeah right by school like very like everywhere I'm a bicycle commuter and I also like and I'll read a lot I'm very good at controlling my temper I don't I mean I'm so good at repressing repressing my feelings are that my very really Express I mean I don't know I don't really Express anger or else I don't really feel anger because I'm not an angry person I may be very disappointed at when something bad happens but that won't erupt in a in a rage I don't feel I don't really feel Rachel but I know I'm so exposed to it all the time on the road I see people like me at all yelling at each other and screaming has so it's yeah I totally cultivate my serenity what time I argue with someone which would have been the job-related arguments and now what I said in school I started English American literature currently unemployed then was my most recent job was at as a as a tutor and before that I've been a grant writer payroll Clerk I've had like an assortment of jobs yeah I agree I agree what's my dream job I'd like to be an editor I'd like to like I'd Publications or like right stories for Publications I feel more comfortable being another Direction more comfortable like working with Pros done with I guess I producing my own. So I like to be like another applications editor yeah travel a lot I'd like to travel I've tried before one of those memorable experiences I I'm pretty close to my family back out here to be closer to them about 2 years ago from Chicago and so I'm closer to them now I'm sick and I'm sorry I don't really understand I'm pretty well Chicago it was fun over there was working as a grant writer and we're there for grad school but either dropping out of grad school but the finding work has been over 5 years I like it alot Mallory situation I'm okay with it right now I'm living with a relative it's it could be better but right now is like right now but employed and it's like I said anything to me stay rent-free and so I'm okay right now before I'm at but I really do need to find another job so I can I get myself stabilized yeah I'm living with my uncle and you know like I say at this place and so he's kind of eccentric I don't know how subscribe them he's pretty out there but anyway he's okay guy do I have a source of what I'm sorry do I have I can really barely hear what you're saying and it's hard for me to understand you sometimes but I'll wait for you to answer me or ask me a question no I haven't no I haven't but I've awesome felt oppressed but I never had a diagnosis of depression I've been feeling good lately I mean relatively I mean I prefer being unemployed and feeling like really angsty over that that's you know I'm in a position where I can you know you know I can't sort of like survive out here which is important and and I'm not homeless which is important so I feel okay I mean yeah I could be doing a lot better on the other hand I'm not on the streets and things could be much worse no I haven't I'm not sure what the question was if I'd like to send some kind of therapy I've been in therapy before but it hasn't I don't know I was supposed to be there people like the therapist and I wasn't like really it didn't really help me out so much like a slight work at my issues but I enjoy talking to a therapist and I guess that's kind of like a pair of the whole situation to to the scenario talking to a virtual human that you just have someone to sit with for a while he will listen to you it someday I could be very soothing Melody I feel that way often well do I feel like I need to talk to someone very often sometimes I mean yeah I do like repressed emotions like man the pretty much I assumed I could ever become black holes with someone I would have someone I can share my thoughts and feelings with butts I was like I guess you can say I do feel what's the word I feel lonely but not lonely but like for a self contained within what's the word within my own sort of sense of self my own feelings and I don't really have a need to reach out as much because I'm a practice God I practice meditation and I totally totally helps me like next to retreat into myself in lights are like fine fine serenity serenity through a lack of desire and soap that helps me with I mean I guess I could loneliness but also I mean maybe it was like you know it like a problem I actually don't reach out to people as often as I should but I definitely neglected relationships because of that and it may all be as like self-centeredness you know but I'm trying to oh yeah this is a good one I want to try to find a way to Lake engage with people without like really allowing myself to let them down so to speak and so that is one of the things that inhibits me from reaching out to people is the idea that I could that I could potentially let them down if they were to place their faith in me or the trust in me and so I'm very reluctant to do that go on how easy it is for me I don't really again I'm only hearing part part of what you're saying and so this is going to throw off my answer I would say it's very easy I mean I can't really like I don't understand the question for Quan what I'm I think I said it would only was afraid of probably most afraid of oh my God being a failure or not being a success finding a stable job not being able to I mean settle down and essentially ain't getting married it's um I don't know I am okay with being single I'm not okay with being jobless I'm so it's like one of those things that's just like I just I don't feel I can reach out to people so because I don't have a job and so I got to like bring them into my mic my life so right right now I'm not in position to like a people I mean they have a lot of friends with us because I can't like really go outside and they can so you know spend money at and restaurants or in clubs or whatever so I'm going to buy to a lots and I think a lot so I meditate a lots and I read a lot of literature I want to go to my felt really happy well just last weekend that was set my my aunt and uncle's 50th one of your anniversary and it was a nice occasion it was really it was not their whole family was there are friendly was there and like my own parents 50th anniversary is coming up 50/50 years together and I felt really happy for them I felt really happy that I got both of them and provided us with like a really a really great childhood and it seems strange I guess I put that kind of starting point but that's something I mean I guess like suit to be floundering right now but I feel happy for the I think I guess locations like that are probably could become rarer on his light on a societal level but that some sort of like Beyond Leon sort of like Realm of happiness and anyway this weekend. I'm on the road on a bicycle and going pretty fast how are your best friends my best friend actually she would describe me as depressed all the time and I asked her about this and he's like I swear if it being around me I had brought her down at all because she was going through her own like for a deep depression that I was kind of trying to coax her out of that but it sometimes myself and so I asked her if you're around me brought her down at all and she said no it's it made her that I had liked it but I take an interest in her but what's the word let's would like my sort of like my depression wasn't like really the net didn't have anything to do with her depression it was completely unrelated to like how I felt and feel like I don't know in both cases it was just good to have someone else to be around who had some respect for like it's like how we felt or like alarm useful sort of like lack of feeling and I can put it that way and so has being brave I seem very depressed all the time and she's my best friend at this moment anything I regret all right thank you goodbye hello and goodbye hello it was kind of interesting as like I should have like told you I had like my ears are kind of kind of clogged and so I had trouble like during her at some at some point,2
417,thank you creative I'm pleased are you okay yes I'm okay a Los Angeles I don't know kind of dirty but that's to be expected from a big city my the last class I need to go to Sociology class I'm not really sure where I'm going with school but I'm thinking about sex education how did you do I think that is a really important job I feel like because there's kind of a Stigmata guess about talking about sex at leads to like a lot of unsafe sex more than planned pregnancies so I feel like it's a very important job for the world I don't know okay I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot lack of funds it depends on the people but I'd say that generally more shy of course of people who I know well like we're closer to me I am more outgoing sometimes when I'm feeling the best of guy play with my dogs I don't know if it's a nice day I'll go for a walk if it's not a nice day then or if it's like cold out or something then maybe watch a show on TV I like or read a book or something I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I can't remember I think the last person I argue with was my boyfriend probably last week but I don't even remember what it was about you feel guilty about I don't think I really feel guilty about anything I say that I regret things but I think there's a difference between guilt and regret like I think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like feeling like you should have made a different decision and I think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future where is guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless I regret not doing better when I was in high school I mean not getting better grades I regret Blake getting involved with certain people in the past but I mean I'm not sure that's about it that I can think of right now you done anything to avoid yeah I mean I mean in the past yeah I could have made different decisions I mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but I'm not going to feel I'm not going to regret things that I had no power over so I'm not sure if I would want to erase it from my memory but I wish that it didn't happen to me was a time that I was raped tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make I can't really think of any hard decisions I can't think of any okay tell me about I'm not sure I can't think of any I have a pretty good relationship with my family not I wouldn't say that I'm really close with my mother but I mean we get along well and I'm very close to my sister we're basically best friends I think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn't like mistake sometimes but I think that she was always there for me when I needed it and she just did her best to raise me so I think she was a big positive influence how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it's been easy lately sometimes I have trouble sleeping but lately I have had no problems it depends how long I've gone without sleep I can just be anywhere from like groggy to Lake really on edge and like extremely tired I have been feeling pretty good I have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been in the past so I'm feeling mostly pretty good I think that I've actually been feeling happier lately I want to say that I'm like really happy all the time I mostly just kind of like a neutral but I have been feeling more positive lately I'm actually not sure if I have been diagnosed with PTSD tell me about I know that I've been seeing a psychologist for like since I was 16 for depression and I think my first psychologist who I saw for a few years thought that I had PTSD but I'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis did you think you had a problem before you found out I'm not sure I don't know yes it's helpful to talk someone and have them kind of guide you in talking about something so that you can figure things this figure out your feelings about things sort of I guess for yourself or like why it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something I mean I think sometimes you can do that on your own but talking to somebody helps I think not sure I'm not sure I'm not sure I think I would spend it mostly at home but it would be sunny out and I would go outside a little bit and and play with my dogs and I probably have my boyfriend over I eat food that I like like only through that I like like my favorite foods watch movie or TV show that I like just kind of have like a relaxing time but that's nice I would tell myself to to to do better in school because throat High School is kind of an underachiever and I ended up going to Community College like on and off because I would like to have lose interest and then not do well or as well as I could have so I would tell myself to do as well as I could in school because I feel like I am capable of a lot more than I do and I think I could easily have gone missing a scholarship if I have done well in high school so I just tell myself to do good in school and probably wore myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time I think I am proud of myself for not being bitter and for wanting to live kind of bitter and yes but I guess I'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to make the world a better place like cuz a lot of bad things have happened to me and I tried to instead instead of dwell on them I try to or I want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as I want to help I guess Empower people to make their lives better,7

music I'm getting better over the years I think I'm pretty decent now compared to how I used to be got you in trouble yes ma'am due to the lack of I guess you can say controlling my emotions I have been incarcerated at the prison okay I'm not sure I don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision I ever made in my life probably few days ago with the girl I was talking to and I was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah I frustrated because you know how you be put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship in the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you can set yourself up for failure or so you know I guess I'm just learning a lot of situations over Hank differently probably the most recent was a I got into a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison in and I had to do a lot more time and if I handled it differently probably wouldn't ever want the president and I probably would have been home a lot sooner than originally happened yet tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory are several events I wish I could erase my memory probably My First Girlfriend she did something really extreme it wasn't necessary my eyes and it and it could have cost me my life I think that that that's a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase memory along with the good memories as well a few YouTube fights shootouts getting job getting robbed you know those things I think those inhibit me I guess to explore certain areas of life that I'm not comfortable with south of the few things that he'll be nice so I can erase it completely yeah hurting people I didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially few women in my life are my past probably put my mother through certain things that shouldn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well tell me about your relationship with your family used to be Rocky growing up but as I got older mature and Discerning spirits that I've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it is pretty decent this is pretty soon I would say my mother yeah mother oh she she she had her share experiences negative and positive I might her the struggle she been through she she she has experienced difficult economic hardship growing up but that didn't stop her for raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her Masters in just just overall being a good person and she also about her mental health issues as well and probably not the best of family that she could have been raised with social so she's kind of like a inspiration to to me and other people as well so I Was Your Mother how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it's not easy so yeah it's not easy I can tell you I've always had sleeping issues why you should just take like over counter sleep medication or NyQuil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it looks like it's a negative effect really the medicate I don't know shitt I don't know but I just stop taking it cuz I don't like to feeling drowsy not good at all can you tell me about that yeah I mean I recently got released from prison not too long ago older now and a lot more responsibilities and I feel

control certain situations better yeah well instead of just always reacting On Emotion no matter what kind of motion it is I stepped back in and then assess the situation and I'll to see what's what's the best way to to react towards situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally mature and just has positive outcome tell me about the last time you felt I was laying next to a beautiful woman who cared about me and the feeling was Mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous outgoing sometimes a little crazy fun that's about it nothing like I said

years in the screenwriting program it took a long time it was difficult just the getting used to and managing the stress of everyday living variety of right here like that Dallas traffic internationally no just haven't had reason to I guess I have a BS in math and physics I went to school later in life and I wanted to actually know something so it was very difficult very difficult but I did it why fascinated me I didn't want to be intimidated by it oh yeah to be employed writer stream Lee difficult extremely difficult writing any type of fictional fiction ride is extremely difficult I worked as hard as I do now when I was in school I have a PhD in math and physics it's so hard outgoing at the present circumstance it's it's not a catch all depends on the the moment what I do to relax I swim swam one last Friday Friday what do I do when I am annoyed swear to myself pretty good pretty good takes a lot to get me to express anger but I do it was in traffic actually that was probably two weeks ago in traffic sure I'm just waiting for the lights and some kind of pickups honking at me and like why humpback so he didn't like that he pulled up alongside me I had to have no idea what his problem was and we had a few words I mean I have no idea what I was doing wrong swipe the light guilty that's a strong word if I feel guilty as I feel remorseful about actions or words said and done in the past they come up oh just passed in interpersonal reactions with friends are family you know it'll just hit you one day you're not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason and just out of the blue it hits you my all why they say that what I do that situation got a blank for me that question has a negative connotation so something that's possibly negative in my recent past what would have done differently I don't I'm pretty in control of my emotions and taking the temperature of the moment and responding my when to respond when and when not to respond so nothing really Springs to mind that I wish I'd done differently recently in my pass pass yes but not recently oh swallowing my pride putting my tail between my legs and saying I was wrong to friends I contacted him again and then we're fast friends again now this is again this is past past so not recent past so probably altercations I've had with my mom and I know things I've said to hurt her I know yeah when you hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks so any time any one of those situations you know so when I think my emotional IQ has ground so I think in the past passed my emotional cues was stuck on infant so so I have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families my father never had a good relationship don't know if that will be possibly still alive but he's Advanced Alzheimer's so he's mad at everybody right now I was fine it was slow Psalm 100 impossible Foods my life my sister's to talk with my sisters extremely easy asleep while it's night anywhere from at least 8 to 10 hours a night oh star Jake just going through the motions you know like this I like this David Lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he's done some crazy stuff are his movies and TVs concerned he said the idea of the tanks driven artist is BS because you want to be creative get a good night sleep I like that good I can't wait to get up and start the day oh if if that happens it's gradual I'm always thinking about my behavior and my thought processes and how to be more productive in my life with what pme me now I don't know I haven't been taking diagnosed with any psychological acronym no this weekend had a good good time with friends with great was with friends and we just were able to talk about you know some things and conversation lasted two and a half hour 3 hours to inspect it to happen was good I like talking with smart people informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare almost like how you get after running or exercising you know the endorphins it was the same thing I am ADD with friends or working on my stuff my writing for exercising my Heights I wish I were taller I wish color of the physicality I wish I didn't wear glasses nothing internal I'm patience I've been commended for my patience by strangers my relationships with my friends and my family I understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them and I take that time and energy well it's a really open general question of course now goes back are you talkin recently are you talkin in the path I always regret I regret the whole thing's not a big thing not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day I hate wasting time I hate wasting money I hate wasting energy that's a deep question I'd say I was co-dependent 10 or 20 years ago I said get some help get some help you got your coat sure I just about button,1
482,okay yes I'm doing fine I was born in Texas and I moved to California when I was three and grew up here in California I was yes I've never been back there I don't have any relatives there don't have a reason to go back there well my at my family's here that's one the weather is great the beaches and mountains are here all those things are very good the traffic was probably most people say it's expensive to live here who's probably talk to you recently I've traveled well you get to see new places in a new people you get to learn more about other cultures and different ways people think how at the end of March and went to Ecuador for a week I spent most of most of one day with with an Ecuadorian who only speaks Spanish and I speak very little Spanish so we got it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him felt like a little kid trying to narrow saying yo what's this what's this is very humbling you're just just saying that and when you don't we're not able to communicate that that can be very difficult I'm probably more of a shy person genetics I don't know why I'm an electrician so I studied electrical construction have also saved a computer networking it was I guess just kind of circumstances I needed the work I was doing wasn't providing for the family and I knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work until so I pursued that because of the financial gain it's giving me a lot of opportunity but I don't think it's why I do what I want to do for the rest of my life well I'm actually pursuing becoming a missionary my wife and I are looking at moving down that Corridor in the fall for 4 years and last year we we trained in North Carolina for one year and that was like Theology and Bible training basically God put a desire in my heart to get Beyond could be on myself and and do something for other people to to go in and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them all my immediate family I have my Mary have been married for 10 years this June and we have four daughters and then but I have one older brother how no sisters to what what do you want to know about my family I'm really close with my wife and my daughters are with my brother I'm not not real close partly because he's at he's mentally handicapped he has the mental capacity of a 7 year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kind of because of that Dynamic it's hard to have a close relationship with him by I'm pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents I tell you my I use fashion high school he was a real real positive influence and me just he has a he has a drive in his heel for for pursuing the truth and just a studying the Bible in and because of his influence that kind of put me on a path to wanting to study the Bible I think I've gotten better at it there have been times when y'all get angry and yo it can just kind of really rule over me just the frustration and I'm the type of person that takes me usually it takes some time for me to get angry and then some time to to calm down again but I've I've learned over time that really getting angry and keeping that anger and doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that I'm angry at it just kind of attacks me it's a really it's not a it's not good behavior to to keep so wet when things anger me I tried to like talk to the person saying it was at this situation is making me upset try to can't talk through it and in resolving come to a resolution even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root of the problem well a couple weeks ago or made it as me being a month ago my wife and I were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left it we're just driving down to Orange County area for this trip and my wife wanted what she had said expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things we packed and but hadn't really and in my eyes had Express that clearly but her eyes she had and so when I was trying to meet those expectations she knew I didn't meet him according to to what she wanted and then she became angry and so from my perspective I was doing what she wanted and kind of getting attacked for it so so that I I started yelling at her and and we know we have that conflict but then yeah we're within an hour so we kind of talked through and we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was are you asking the moment of during the conflict very ill just very angry you know you can feel it in your body part part of the anger is play the secondary response but my initial response was that on if it was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so I would think yes or no should I felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger I guess it was deciding to go hum to go toward training last year I felt the guy to put on my heart that this was something I supposed to pursue my wife didn't feel that way and I I just feel very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time I knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it would kind of fall apart so I kind of relinquished it and I said her you know I'm not going to make you go your life if you want to go then then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going so that that was difficult for me cuz you again that I kind of felt like a loss cuz I felt deeply that that's what I was supposed to do but then after I kind of gave that up then then she came to a point where she said no I have a piece about not doing this and I went ahead and pursuit at so so just kind of giving it up what was it was difficult for me tell you about something bad or something that I can erase my memory I miss you not sure I don't know I can't really think of anything very traumatic that I would want to erase I think you're good things and positive and good things and bad things they all kind of shape who we are and so I I can't think of anything that would want to erase usually usually it's not too bad are you referring to on the the questionnaire when I said that I had some trouble sleeping that the job a works at the kind of the scheduling a shifted so I so lately I've been working some night time shifts or graveyard shifts so coming home in the morning you know when it's light and it's been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly cuz I was staying up so late because of work pretty easy what I do when I don't sleep that I do get cranky I've been feeling good lately no not really no no her--no can't think of anything that was cut out of the ordinary but yesterday we my wife and I took two or three younger girls we took him to the park the oldest one stay with her grandma but we we took him to the park and they played and yeah so that those are always happy times we take the kids to the park I think you say I'm a family man sad I'm a Dependable that he can he can count on me usually might my friend I end up doing different work around the house for him cuz I'm kind of a handyman so so that way I think you say I'm kind of Dependable or someone you go to for advice I guess I would I guess I would like to be able to start conversations with people easier sometimes I have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if people are 101 then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kind of talking to people in a group how I wish I was a little better at that now if it's okay what was it say right before that was that if if I'm giving a speech or something to a large group I don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing that's kind of call advisor we're going to myself turn 20 years ago I probably would have been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life that's about it think I'm that would have been the biggest difference in my life I think what if I have 4 Kids and I hope I'm raising him right I hope that that alarm for the mistakes that I've made I can kind of guide them

481,can't you see me right now okay hello yeah I am good to moderate Los Angeles yeah I'm from just a lot of different kinds of people and I love the weather most of the time and great creative seeing I'm really into music so it's a great scene for that I don't like driving I don't know who does right it's just it's just such a drag and getting from point A to point B is just the daily need and it doesn't get any easier too many people too many people can't see your shoes yeah when I can I want when I can afford to being somewhere else not having to drive usually must places have better public transportation just mean I'm a culture junkie I like experiencing different types of cultures so that's how many places I've been to like Mexico and Italy it it's I want to go to more places I want to go to Japan so that'll be interesting and usually this is my family my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just yeah we go to Italy we spent two weeks there though I was cool yeah living next to the best gelato shop in Italy we were we were in Florence spent a spend a week in Florence that was great big very good culture there as well art studied film and digital media cuz I make music and I want to learn how to make music videos so it's someone trying to get into yeah yeah I mean I need to get a camera that's the thing but I've been with my main focus is music I studied film but my focus is music can you tell me about sure I've been playing music and playing guitar keyboard bass drums for about 12 years now and I do production and songwriting an indie rock band that's a great website I highly recommend it and it's it's mine so Shake It Up International Rockstar music producer and filmmaker director probably are going I'm just feel like it's the way to get the most out of life talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's a territory yeah I do meditation and it's not really hard cuz it's fun and it it relaxes me and helps me Focus the same time which I know that that was a huge Epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time cuz they're only when I'm relaxing I'm tuning out I'm focusing on something else but to be able to come by in the sensations was yeah I've been doing that for about 3 months now so yeah it is almost to get a tax sometimes others things that should be said that I that I don't just because you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example I got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily so you can do anything to them and I've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but yeah I make deal probably argued with the guitarist for my band we had a falling-out we're not going to be in a band together and we're still friends so at least it's that but it was just basically about creative control the project and how we're going to prioritize it and in our lives and you know we just our priorities weren't the same and I got very upset so that was the end of that I felt good that it was definitive that it was no choice has been made on both parties also regretful that you know he didn't feel the way that I want him to feel about it which was excited about the project so the fact that he wasn't really in it kind of pissed me off but I got over it any I got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me even honored so you know I'm gone thank you I don't know I don't really I don't really have any regrets like that at the moment I can't really think of any when I was in high school I cheated on my girlfriend I don't think it would mean anything it's time but I did it I regret it but I you know you know life happens you make some mistakes selfishness being young and thinking it would matter you know thinking you know you only live once and you know for me it's probably for the best ultimately cuz you know I love my current girlfriend and I would never do that to her so that was that was years ago but and she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so I got it shit genzyme I guess whether to go to college or not cuz I had some projects going in La that I didn't really want to shut off a dab and going get a manager we were playing out a lot and I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and I made the decision to go to school in Santa Cruz and and start a new life there for four years and it was difficult decision but I'm glad I did send that a lot of people a lot of people I'm still close with today that and we work on stuff together and all that so good I agree that is good thank you maybe I wish I could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when I was 4 by Danish babysitter you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and I I don't forget so have a pretty vivid picture of it and I'd be happier if it wasn't there positive there a sportive give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that I keep things in perspective and terms of creative projects that I make so yeah there's a bit of tension there just cuz they expect certain things from me and I expect them as well but I just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer but they're sweet people how do I cope with them I do know what they're lovely people at their core you know cope with them cuz I love them I just no X I'll just go off on my own for a while and you know take a breather or whatever and they have everyone makes you mad sometimes so how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep challenging I just I try doesn't work sometimes I have to take medication for it at to take Ambien something like that I'm someone who sleeps in late so I always get at least six or seven hours if I have to wake up early for something I get nauseous sometimes I'll throw up in the morning yeah I've had jobs where I wake up and you know vomit while I'm brushing my teeth it's horrible it does suck its kind of something I'm worried about you know I kind of need to get some part-time work while I'm not you know getting a steady payflow for my music production so yeah it's pretty rough got some stuff I need to get over I'm not really sure how just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something that it doesn't sit well with me like being in a yeah I rushed and you know stressful work environment just unless it's about something that I care about you no like music or the Arts it's just very hard to give a shit frankly like and you know I try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe I'll have a Red Bull or something and your body doesn't want that in the morning it just like my body rejects things and yeah okay I've been feeling okay very very reflective for contemplative now there's going to be some changes and it's going to be some new people in my life some new people in my band and I'm going to try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time cuz you know I expect more for myself it's just pissing me off when I get mad at me. Basically feel like I'm shiting all over myself my body sitting on me anyway just by being so so shity yeah no yes I was diagnosed 12 years ago I haven't been in therapy since they gave me Zoloft and I don't like it made me feel worse than I do in the shittiest moments I was telling you about it it made me feel numb I don't want to feel numb I want to feel everything even if it sucks being forced to this private school they thought I was acting up I thought I was up at a kid I think I was just being a kid so yes I do well I haven't been in in 12 years but I do think that it might be helpful for me in the future can you tell me about that I thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there well yeah I kind of want to go back to therapy and might help might help me buy some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist any maybe it's a life coach I have no idea but I'll be seeking help soon yesterday I was watching a movie with my girlfriend and I looked over at her and smiled at each other and it was great yeah very honest sometimes brutally so but I'm a good guy I think they're my friends all think I'm a gay guy funny open minded I guess that's what I'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through my body rejecting shittiness of the world it gets better stay in shape gets harder the longer you wait give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing my music you're welcome miss talking to you,7

Or people were like really rude you know with the way they cut you off almost luckily not you know I'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes we're if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot I'll I'll confront them on that sometimes might have been with my sister I had to do with I'm not sure of the topic but whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it sounds childish about who was right you know cuz she thinks she's always the smarter one cuz she's older sometimes it's frustrating cuz it's like it's a no-win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody till you know they acknowledged that she's right other times I just let it go and let her ride along cuz it's those kind of non productive I'm real close to I see my parents almost every weekend more close to my mother I have a twin sister I stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and I've got two other sister so I stay in touch with all of them you know it's a mixed bag you know be kind of assertive aggressiveness in us in a little bit but also well me and ever I mean stranger sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me to strangers have been very sometimes unexpectedly very nice I could be shopping and you know maybe I can't reach something and some guy I'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out that type of thing or if somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody all like commiserate you know anti I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me cuz he thought I didn't like his dog was you know I'm not crazy about dogs but he kind of flipped out for a year-and-a-half and just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around I wish I had confronted that back then because I yeah but it create a lot of anxiety for me cuz I feel like I could have nipped it in the bud and instead of having to deal with the major stress from it now he and I don't talk at all I just feel it's best it's kind of odd God there's been a lot sometimes breaking up with somebody or yeah Sushi or getting rid of a friend that type of thing sometimes I feel guilty about some of my past Behavior with people or maybe I wasn't his understanding when I was younger I stole things you know that's not the best behavior and kind of stuff like that oh God there's a lot of them I wish I could have raised you know how tough my dad was on us as children and erase a lot of memories of men I dated that just didn't work out well at all now I can drop off like right away cranky irritated snarky I've been out of sorts some I've had some anxiety with money and relationships cuz I haven't been in one for so long male just a lot of anxiety take a deep breath trying to do positive things so you know sometimes eat healthy or work out more talk to my friend about it that type of thing try and look for interesting activities to do to distract me will not officially but I know you know from things have experience that I've had you not get very anxious and certain situations yeah it's usually triggered by sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally or sometimes if they're too much in my my space you know where I am if it bothers me yeah a long time ago ages ago maybe over 10 years ago 15 years ago I was depressed I mean it's nothing to laugh about but I mean it's kind of a circle just to want to be more positive and enjoy life more feeling stuck in certain thoughts I'm having a lot of negative thoughts feeling of hopelessness helplessness that type of thing I go occasionally it's a different type I'll go see a hypnotherapist sometimes to release anxiety that's in me yes I do very useful I want more awareness of myself and other people learning more control more confidence better self-esteem willing to try even more things you know whether I know the outcome or not you know of the unknown I'll experiment a lot more helping like at the 25th mile heading out water and there are some people there who are doing that for the first time also some event at my sister's where they were just a couple of us and I was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes I'm like really funny you know and I can't even believe myself and I just go on and you know that one starts laughing I'm not even trying to and I'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny laugh yeah as a really decent loyal empathetic deserving supportive I'm hoping outgoing quirky type of person look be great to look even younger or be younger if that was humanly possible be even more patient with people I think you know not get frustrated like if I think somebody is not very smart sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people well wow make a lot of money and plan for your future and try and be as kind of impatient with people as possible and have a lot of fun trying new things I think of my mind and my perseverance that I've changed a lot of things within my personality I feel proud of volunteer work I feel proud I felt a bunch of people lose weight declutter their homes and helped create a lot of positive change in people okay it was nice talking to you when she nods her head a lot,3
425,all right okay thank you and please are you okay with yes I'm okay doing a little tired and worried well I am looking for a place to live and I don't have a job right now so things are you sore a little shaky for me these days where do you live I'm staying with my son in Venice it's pretty good but both of us need to have our own space so that's why I'm looking for another place to live originally from New York but I've been in California since the early 70s yeah I moved to LA because I had been living in Portland Oregon and I was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seems like a good place to be how easy was it for you to get used to living in LA and it wasn't too hard I I met people right away and I just really liked it here so it was it was easy to connect with people the weather is number one for most people I love being near the ocean I like the energy I like if they are like the artistic culture well everybody loves the traffic and me loves the weather and hates the traffic so I kind of feel I feel the same way sometimes it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult I see what you mean I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer you travel a lot I know not as much as I'd like if if I had more and more income more friends I would travel more I mostly have been may I travel as let's say so my longest trips it was out of the country was to Mexico and I traveled drove down with a friend down to Oaxaca and the whole trip we took about about 4 weeks going down and back from the Bay Area yeah that was a fun trip well we've been working together on the census and if she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her from that trip I would say we were in Oaxaca for a Day of the Dead so it was celebrating Day of the Dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in at everybody in the village makes an altar in their house for their loved ones who have passed away and they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that I studied I was in the liberal arts program but I didn't stay stay only stay in school for in college for a couple of years but I was most interested in Liberal Arts and Humanities dream job my dream job would be personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to travel and go to events with them how hot is it it's hard to break into I'm starting now very minimally with somebody who I'm doing more of a volunteer work with and I'm I'm working on building up some of my skills so that I can be doing more of that I'm fairly I'm kind of a friendly introvert so you know I have no trouble meeting people I don't hold back and you know I just am not like shy at parties I'll go up and talk to people but I am over all kind of introverted so I prefer one-on-one then big groups I like to watch I like to watch improvement shows like HGTV I like to watch I agree model shows and and see Transformations or watch movies or read I play some Solitaire on my my Kindle Fire okay how are you at controlling your temper I don't usually realize I'm mad until later it doesn't really come up and I just tend not to have the kind of life where those situations arise us sometime soon of sometimes on the road I get a little annoyed I don't get annoyed so much I like when people cut me off or anything like that but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or you know it when they get angry because maybe I've done something inadvertent nail cut them off by mistake and you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry and return When was the last time you argue with yeah I like I said I don't really get into arguments I did have I was with a friend the other day and she got annoyed with me because she felt like I was correcting her so it wasn't really an argument but she I had said something that she heard as a correction while it was a correction and she got angry well then I felt criticized and I felt I felt vulnerable I wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable well in that situation I didn't I didn't have to correct her so I think that's something I'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right so in general that's I'm trying to to catch that and just let people make mistakes with without my telling them about it I don't know that's Tuff I can't know that I've had that much trouble making decisions well hard for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick oh it was and I had to give up a cat and I was moving once and and that was difficult to well in the case of the first cat the one that was sick I decided when the vet said that he thought it was the Humane decision and with cat I had to give up I didn't I didn't really decide I was moving to a place that where I couldn't take her and so I thought I found somebody who could take her say that stuff I don't really have that the erasing from the memory part there's nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory trying to think of something that I've done that I wish I hadn't done oh okay I remember something they were there was a time when I was I was in a class at Junior College it was a film class and I was I was the one who was after we we went out and did a little film project and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week I was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now and never went back to the school but I never brought them to film back so all the work they have done I had to do over again and I still feel bad about that but it's pretty easy sometimes I wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often how to concealing lately I've been feeling kind of tired and low-level depressed like not feeling a lot of options no yes I have oh there were two times there was once back in like 1970 290 about 1972 or 3 and then another time oh so then would that have been in bed 16 years ago just feeling like there wasn't you know feeling the feeling that things weren't going to change if I didn't get some help and that if I I didn't have to let you know that maybe if I got some medication that would help me and the short-term I'm not going to therapy right now Travis moving around alot finances there wasn't really feeling the need starting to think it might be an option again I feel like therapy can be useful well when I went to therapy it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way I was feeling I was on the beach last weekend was beautiful day and I was sitting in the sun and just relaxing I had my notebook can I was doing some writing and I felt very happy and content I'm kind and compassionate and I'm a good listener and I'm intelligent and I have five good ideas well I wish that sometimes I wish I was a harder worker I'm not really willing to take low-wage jobs even though I need work so I just don't feel like I'm willing to do anything and I wish I could act as I said I had good ideas I have good ideas and I'm good at the the onset but I'm not really good on the follow-through so a lot of those ideas get started but then I don't take them the distance that's probably the the thing I'd like to change my myself the most 10 or 20 years ago I'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree finish my education and be willing to to work a regular job and two to start putting money away for my retirement what are you most proud of in your life

in San Francisco are nicer my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that's why we moved okay I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and after that I went to law school when I was in college I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting are you still working in that no now I'm a stay-at-home mom you find it easy to be a parent know I loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person it's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know I'm good at that the hardest thing I think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he's having a hard time with feeling like I don't have all the answers I'm just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it's just it's really really cool what are some ways that your completely different completely different and I am not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all well my parents are dead I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died I have a sister and a brother that actually I don't know where they are I don't speak to them either do you consider yourself more shy probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved I like to listen to music like what I have I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when I'm relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true it depends on who I'm with if I'm with my son I can control my temper if I'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don't so so yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married can you tell me about that I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her yeah really angry and just really hurt I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage because he was cheating on me that would have to be well I don't know I mean I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today but I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don't get a good night sleep it's not easy I wake up a lot in the night I don't know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I I just don't I don't know what are you like when you don't grumpy irritable grumpy irritable down mixed with anger can you tell me about it's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband yeah there's I just keep it inside Meador Staffing else to really do except I mean it is what it is so I have to deal with it no yes 10 years ago after my son was born 9 years ago I felt like I couldn't cope with life I was so down I couldn't I felt like I couldn't do anything I need no I don't go to therapy I go to medication management but I don't do talk therapy I have gone to a therapist and no they don't help can you tell me if well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything you know if I wanted to talk to myself I would others give advice that I think is just it just not not good and not on point tell me about the last time you felt it was probably this morning I was playing with my son just really happy I wasn't thinking about any of the other crap in my life I could just forget it so I was feeling really really happy I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me but I think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident outgoing because that's what I try to be two people so I think that's how they would describe me I wish I wasn't sad I wish I was more confident yeah there are a lot of things I think it would be to not not give my life over to one particular person which is what I did with my husband find your ideal weekend I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so I think have been really positive influences in my life can you tell me if sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together is just really positive me she's always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot my son I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening thanks for sharing your thoughts with me my okay,10
447,yeah that's perfectly fine I'm feeling great it's an early morning I don't have school born and raised in Los Angeles California the fact that you can serve snowboard and like do to drastically different things in one day coming from the neighborhoods I've lived in I'd say the population of lower socio-economic backgrounds it's like a cesspool almost for young African-Americans and it sucks not really I've been to New York Connecticut Mexico and Texas but pretty young mostly if I'm traveling by plane just decide in the air is amazing it's remarkable the first time I went to New York I was about 11 years old and I made sure I got the the window seat on the plane and just a feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but we left at night here in LA and it was the next day in New York so it's kind of confusing getting used to the time change and the first thing I remember doing is getting a slice of New York Pizza it was it was delicious yep graduating with the bachelor's degree in Communications so I can go into the military as an officer what made you decide to do actually like would I don't know it's like you got to have a plan it's the only thing that's just falling into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me what's your dream job to be honest job that doesn't exist however you can get paid to do nothing yeah but probably I was definitely shy as a kid but I've grown into myself through the experience of college so I'm way more outspoken I write music and I work out mostly so if I'm feeling stressed out I just do a set of push-ups and lifting weights I'm pretty good I saw a therapist when I was a kid for about a year and I don't know if he told me to just be able to control my emotions and I don't think I do it in the best way because when I'm angry I do decide to like just bottled in my emotions instead of letting them out in their appropriate Outlets not really it's been more of a in interpersonal thing that's I don't know I don't know probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that than Hu so many I guess in my senior year of high school I waited till the last minute to apply for the UC schools and it was unsuccessful because I didn't get to turn in applications and I'm pretty sure I would have been admitted so it sucks but hey tell me about that is an intriguing question I've actually no clue the death of my grandmother sure my grandmother died when I was 11 years old she raised me from the time I was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin is well and her five children so she's the matriarch of our family and the closest thing I've had to a mother it was tough but it's going to be 7 years dismay next on the 30th and I've grown quite a bit No More Tears I'm a foster kid so I was emancipated from the Foster program about 2 years ago now but my immediate family are pretty close with him as much as I can and my foster family they're awesome I've known them since I was 5 so it's been pretty cool how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep fairly easy I fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting and then it's a problem a little moody in the morning I guess I drive more aggressively a little stressed about a few problems that I can take care of but I shouldn't stress because either can do something about it or I can't mess this way things work can you tell me about Usher I have a few parking ticket not parking tickets are not moving violations but their tickets and I was unaware of if you miss Court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not been making your court date so I have 3 failure to appears in court with tickets that are thousands of dollars and I have no money so I don't know if it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but there's so many barriers and obstacles that like you you didn't foresee so I don't know it gets stressful at times and yeah thinking about it for periods of times some days I just sit and I'm just lost in my thoughts and I don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me early so I just bottle it up like I do everything not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing I believe no no really happy why is that such a difficult question I don't know I'm pretty content with everything right now I don't know about extreme happiness everyday is just the same day seems like dunking across the street at the Clippers center is a basketball court there and I've been working on it for a while and I finally got up yet I have 4 close friends that I've known for over eight years each and I don't know Studios hard-working determined I don't know yeah probably my metabolism which I don't really have control over some I don't know I'm pretty content with myself tell me about I think in my sixth grade year of grade school I was I wasn't the best of students but I had a teacher who was diligent and like he felt me the whole year but I learned a lot and I developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation I overcome after feeling so bad and down the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because it wasn't for his like sternness I don't think I would have gained the discipline to be where I am at now in college and stuff so I remember this time I was in the desert or up in Joshua Tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and his Jeep would get over a rock so it was it was pretty yes it was kind of weird and I thought I was Superman I try to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn't work but yeah we eventually got out without going to be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time I got to drive in the desert when I didn't have my license owes fun about that day or in general other than like the UC thing like what I didn't apply to the schools and time I regret that I don't know I was I was 10 years old 10 years ago I probably say to myself no clue that's that's an interesting question Bing the first from my Mediacom immediate family is in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college so yes it's pretty no problem,1
451,okay thank you and please are you okay yes okay other than this laryngitis I have a Cleveland Ohio in 79 I think it was once a year or something like that or less there's a lot more to do here they're a little more narrow-minded back there and Republican well originally Show Business but probably to get away from Cleveland it was very difficult at first I'm not used to change I don't like change very much you know having to meet new people and figure out how to make a living well I like the different opportunities you have the different the health Consciousness the movies the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather the driving the congestion some of the superficial attitude the importance well not a lot but I do I just came back from Vegas to visit relatives we met there and I'm going to Mexico next month well seeing the different cultures like I've been to Europe Greece France Italy I like going to places such as Mexico or it's going to be sunny and just lying out I went to last year I went to Arizona and ever saw Sedona that was really an experience peaceful about Sedona yep well Sedona is a very energetic place and I thought it was Desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was very Rocky and when you land in Flagstaff there's these beautiful pine trees and the elevation is high and then coming into the doughnut was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that I had there for months so anyhow this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had the energy so is really very mystical in life or incident in life well being on stage in Boston and that was great I love doing that just being with friends and laughing some of my highest moments when we were laughing hysterically well I don't know if a particular situation but when I when I decorate for special events and I worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laughing and I can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody who's in tune with my sense of humor and gets my jokes and you know I get his and we're just enjoying that moment speech and drama I am a traitor oh no not now I always was interested in musical comedy when I was a child I would sing along to records in my living room and I was always inquires in school and then when I went to HighSchool I join the drama club and I just always had an interest and I always had a big personality and well I don't know if I have a dream job anymore I'm 60 and I don't know if I have aspirations anymore to towards doing anything right now I just rather not work in chest relax and travel but I like being creative and in any way I can I like Independence and I kind of have that right now so I'm okay I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got well I I watched my favorite television shows that I've recorded and I also am a Buddhist I've been a Buddhist for gosh since 1988 and I'm at District leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to Center me and bring out my higher self so if I get tense or nervous I I chant sometimes okay sometimes not a lot yes yes less and less though it's been happening less and less but yeah sometimes it's got its hit some created difficulties well I can't remember an argument I remember getting angry like was just when I was on my trip in Vegas I was driving and the GPS said stay in the left lane and I stayed in the left lane but when I get off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about 4 miles out of our way and I just I got very angry for about 30 seconds and then I had to call myself down and say okay alright so we're going to be late and I had to talk myself out of it so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but I felt kind of bad that I overreacted you mean in my life many's yes Ashley so many I just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like they're not going to use me on a job or something that I would take an attitude that I'll find something better it's okay and move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me and you know did I do something wrong and then get angry at the Hammond you know that whole thought process that really doesn't help the situation can I do that more often but I since I started chanting but it doesn't you know I'm not always in my highlights get to where I can do that I find a lot of situations to talk to me like you know what television to buy yours but I guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and or leaving my comfort place if the decision meant that I had to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me and probably leaving a relationship very hard because it your I get dependent on that relationship so I usually live it out until that's for it. It's believed or something and it's very hard for me to make that decision that this isn't right and I have to move on so what I usually do is I don't make the decision and I end up suffering with longer cell can we move on how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep well it's hard because I don't know if it's because I have pain in my back and neck but it's difficult for me to stay asleep I I don't get it a deep sleep but because of it so it's hard to say because right now I have this cold and I've had it for 2 weeks so I've been taking Nyquil and that's been putting me to sleep so I have been sleeping better because of it but last night I had woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell but before that all happened I was finding it difficult to stay asleep and so therefore I'm tired during the day and sometimes I'm groggy sometimes I'm irritable but I'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or emotional things are or are not I'm sorry could you repeat that have I studied changes in my behavior no I was not no oh why I was like happy last week you know can you tell me about the well I was going to Vegas to meet my family with my my family is flying in from Cleveland to there we have a relative in Vegas and I drove with my friend and it was my brother-in-law 70th birthday so we all went and had a good time in Vegas and I was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice well are they think I'm funny they feel that I say it like it is then they all say they understand me so people who don't understand me I think sometimes don't know how to take me cuz I'll I'll say something sometimes it come up come across sarcastic but that's just the way I talk so my the anger that sometimes Wells up in me you know I just but although that that really made me I think a lot of the person that I am you know all the all of your experiences make you who you are and how you handle them makes you who you are and if you don't have those Lowe's you don't really know what hyzaar so I don't I can't really go back and regret and I wish certain things didn't happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handled today and I wish that well I can't I don't wish I know that I will have less of these moments where I just burned out you know anger or something I just wish that would happen more or less that anger Parts what happened less and they are so I guess it will having less don't give up hope live in the moment and everything will everything will work out everything will work out and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear the fact that now and for the past 20 years 20 some years I've been cultivating myself and I've been I've become a more compassionate person and I'm able to understand people better and see that you know they're they're suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect if they're they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems to you able to live a better life because you're not allowing that to affect you if you're not taking it personally and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate you're you're happy and your life is happy okay,4
400,all right thank you are you okay with this yeah I'm fine Pacific Grove California the wholesale opportunities and all the stores and anything I could ever ask for the traffic is the mood of the people and the unhealthy pace I would see I did like culinary and I did really good in art and music in high school through my own will and desire to want to get involved with the music no open up a health practice of some sort what made you decide to do that changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the for the benefit of Health I'm sure you can tell by my shoes do you travel when I have the opportunity buying things seeing the culture relaxing not thinking about the city well yeah I used to go to Texas every every year with my dad during the summer and I always wanted to stay there and live there when I went on vacation most likely one of these trips to Texas where we would go and spend time in the desert shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that it was I'll see y my dad and I are not really talking that much and my mom Dust Away about 2 months ago I'm sorry to hear that thanks definitely Marsh I always been that way I just a personality that I've grown into but learning how to adjust the sensitivity and grow out of it sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got teen eating I like to eat that make that calms me down not that good when I get really upset that it's usually a problem and I have to work to come myself down and sometimes I just don't get on something and I don't stop sometimes but I've learned to control it to that extent now when was the last time you yesterday I was arguing about what's what kind of water we should be drinking oh well a difference of opinion and I felt as though my opinion was very valid even though the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed definitely everyday is growing process I wish I would have handled everything differently every day which is what makes me grow and I tried to work toward okay tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to can't think of anyone right now what's something you feel guilty about find I'd I'd say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices I'd rather not get into it the raw food Educators on YouTube and raw vegan Educators and the detox therapy therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past 2 months well that they believed that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like T Colin Campbell The China Study the sources of information that are that are very good and I think deserve respect based on you know real research how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep really easy I've almost got it down to a science what are you like when you don't say I'm tired I'm feeling better than I have in a long time oh yeah I think it's due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that's actually you know losing them talks and some things that I've accumulated over my short lifetime of you know toxic choices with Food and Drugs or whatever it would be yes I'm less tense and less irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my decisions in my wants versus what I need that sort of thing nope yes to some extent our 5 years ago lack of motivation and basically make my symptoms were paralleling that of depression loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of social situations and the main for 5 no I believe I overcome to chapter in my life that was the the doctor you know taking control my health and experimenting with drugs and I just sort of took another route which was alternative and I started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what I needed with help of the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that yes can you tell me if I believe therapy is useful because without looking inward or having somebody to help you to that it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resume in the subconscious and tell you you know it has an outburst is basically therapy will help an overall health and mental health I believe fairy last night I made a really great vegan dinner with no meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot of almost converted them I would say you know I'm trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar or as you know my body needs something other than that apple it's very very hard it's a daily process tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad I was handling money for a business partner and they ended up short and I was to blame but it was actually my formula crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change I make the formula so the blame is on me that I may have took money and I automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy my uncertainty to the change of formula is there anything you regret no 20 years ago I was two years old 10 years ago is 12 years old I would tell myself to to start eating raw fruits and vegetables everyday as calm and sad maybe

407,oh so she's like going to be counselor kind of and then I just press that and then we just have that again and they're done cool haikal are you okay yes I'm actually I feel pretty good cuz I I I slept all day yesterday almost I'm usually doing something if not work it's cool if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so I actually didn't have work yesterday and I don't have school on have school on the weekdays so I actually slept probably like 85% of the days I actually feel kind of good but I'm actually kind of tired as well I have other stuff going on but other than that I'm good today okay I'm originally from Bakersfield California really I'm so late when I was an infant and I'm left here when I was around 3 or 4 and I've been moved I moved back here in 07 and I've been living here ever since well since I've been here since 07 I've only been back maybe maybe like couple why were there at 4 like a summer like in 08 I think I was there for like almost all summer but I don't even back up a couple times and since I've been back here unfortunately it compared to La doesn't really compare. I grew up in Sacramento actually I didn't get to tell you I was born in Bakersfield and I lived here anyways I don't know if I did I forgot anyways yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small as to Valley La has all the stuff to do has oceans and his file kinds of located on by a lot of cool places like Vegas and San Diego and what have you not but yeah other than that I miss my friends and stuff that I don't miss like actual City I just missed some of the people that I grew up with I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I can't see your shoes but I don't travel after I've only been out of California like six time so I would like to travel inside have enough money to do so I want to be a filmmaker and which I still want to be a filmmaker and I said I was 10 I took Communications and the general that stuff too and took my video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to I'm filmmaking and I have learned a lot of stuff and I still have that knowledge however I haven't really used it since I've been back here in La I did all that stuff in Northern California in Sacramento but and then I transfer switch over to be at the business which I took some classes in that but now I'm actually studying to be an optician and I'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get infield and become an optician so but I do want to be I still want to be a filmmaker and I'm that still one of my plans and I still actually I got into I'm playing poker 2 years ago and I really like the idea of becoming a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player have it both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of it have to be like a small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere 3 oxygen I guess I was just trying to find something that it was like it it's like a trade it supposed to private college but it just like specifically trained you into one feel then you just learned that you don't do like your GED and all these other classes like you normally do for like like a major or whatever you're going to do so it just trains you to civically to be auditioning and jump in the field I took it just because I actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe I could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually got my attention to be optician so I'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting so it's fine it's really hard but it's interesting in it and it and it's it's fine we want to benefit this far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel welcome for what I'm definitely outgoing however I can be shy sometimes like I'm kind of shy right now because talking to you and your computer and your cartoon or animated or whatever but no usually 98% I turn on the hey but it's the best I've got I actually was actually kind of funny and I think maybe this might go further some of the poker players to really I've never really talked to any professional poker player to be as far as like I actually playing poker is actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like stuff in the past or present or future stuff is coming up as far as like I am really would I really do not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kind of like a therapy thing for me cuz I don't like I guess you could say the kind of drug because I don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed our stuff that's happened in the past I just like focus on poker so it's actually kind of relieved and however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so I guess it's kind of like a catch-22 or whatever but yeah so no poker I put like to play basketball I like to watch movies I can go to the beach actually one of the things I like to do is go to the beach cuz it does it makes me feel good but I usually when you go to the beach when it's hot. During the cold season so it's coming up soon so looking forward to that I'm really busy but I'll try to go to the beach because I can't I'm really good at controlling my temper actually I've only been in like I'm 30 years old I've been in like six fights maybe and all six of them were started by the other person so I've never started a real fight in my whole life like I started fighting a little kid but talking about like a real stuff like what you get past like 13-14 but yeah I know I'm good like every now and then like there's been in the past were like I wasn't able to control it but as far as I ever being violent or anyting that's never occurred and never would but for the majority of the time yeah I don't have like people do stupid things all the time and I just like Let It Go expect to like I'm on the freeway and stuff but oh I mean I get about with my ex girlfriend a lot but it was just about really Petty things I guess that maybe we just I think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because we just bumped head too much so obviously she's my ex-girlfriend probably for a reason so we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend thing I guess my film there's a lot of stuff I got to handle differently about maybe like when I was doing really good when I was younger and I was working for production assistant for a filmmaker's around where I live in Sacramento so I was doing everything that I want to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot on my stuff together I have my own car mode apartment and then I got involved with like the wrong group of people I guess and kind of tumble down hill from there in like lost everything like our apartment so I just wish that maybe I never got involved with those kind of people that kind of girl ever because I would probably a pirate my life probably a lot different now however I believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously I think you should also like stuff that happens good or bad learn from your mistakes so that when it happens again you could not make that mistake our try not to make it as bad yes so you know I guess hardest decision the hardest decision I have ever had the maid would be I guess you could say I don't really know can I say that I maybe like my ex-girlfriend like I couldn't like stayed with her and I really like it still am in love with her and would like to be with her and miss her but I guess the biggest decision that I had to make was like I know that wasn't like a healthy relationship and I know if we like stay together if we got married or have kids that I don't think would end up working out anyways so I guess the decision the hardest decision would be till like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and not with her so I guess that was a hard really hard decision because I could easily have done it and I guess maybe I would have been happier that way but stressed out and irritable or whatever and other way of having to deal with her iguess deal with each other our relationship so it's really hard still is so I guess that's not choosing to be with someone that I loved and loved me or whatever so what was that I beg your pardon navad I understand the first part of that question oh an event own event okay that can erase event that I can erase for my memory IMAX girlfriend I wish I never met her my first girlfriend in my last girlfriend I wish I never met them cuz we were we were together and love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so I guess both of them how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep extremely I could fall asleep anywhere I actually the other day I broke a record I almost fell asleep standing up which would have been weird because I guess I would have fallen down or something I don't know I just caught myself I guess I was I mean I was really tired but I do a lot of stuff so it's hard for I don't really get that much sleep as much as I would like but I can sleep when I'm dead or whatever have they said I know no lately I'm just tired but I'm all right I guess I'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month and a week but it's actually is not I mean I've had worse things happen I mean worst things happening had worse things happen to us well-known religious person that I'm Catholic I believe in God I know there's a God so obviously even though all of it even devoted people to God regardless of what they are they sometimes stay so I do stay sometimes but definitely last for that long and I know that there is a God and I know that I'll be okay and everything will be okay but you know it's hard to deal with them like I don't really I just keep going and I go to school and work and I just have to keep going I can't give up so I just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of been like sleeping a lot house but I don't go to sleep a lot so I don't know playing poker playing basketball helps me deal with him hanging out with my friend sometime I felt really happy on Friday because I went to San Diego for the first time and I didn't it wasn't as cool as I thought it would be but we're like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so I would much rather been free during that time but I wasn't but we had fun it was cool I enjoyed it so yeah I really like that I was at fun and I was happy about going to San Diego for the first time and I am had a good time a lot of things but I guess I would say like be nicer to like family members know a couple family members that I wish I would have been different to at the different to not that I was like a horrible but I could have been nicer in some instances that if I didn't know the situation at hand and I would have never like really went out and partied all the time like I did like Highschool different part times of a type I would have just really focused on schooling and stuff them in to the party later would have gotten relationships that I'm sorry I just told myself more basely to be more have more Direction be more focused I guess I stay away from people and unhealthy relationships and healthy people I guess not that I'm the healthiest but yeah I just want it done a lot of stuff different but I don't know if she said earlier but I believe everything happens for a reason so I guess everything is happening now for reason something to keep going I guess there's a few that I do have a few that I used to have cuz I have best friends now couple I guess one new one and I've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like 100 ways but I guess they're all probably describe me more as like energetic funny crazy loud silly smart and I just I guess in general just like entertaining to be around I have I haven't always been the best bestest best friend but I tried you know my hardest so that's cool change myself I wish I was I wish I was like 15 pounds lighter I wish I didn't need how do I set potatoes I feel like I feel like I'm I feel like I need to be like in a relationship with a girl but I feel like I wish I didn't have to be like feel like that I needed to have a girl all the time and so I get that step dad in my life but that sometimes I'm working on that what am I most proud of I'm most proud of almost I guess I guess I'm most proud of working for television station back in Sacramento and working on a lot of them film sets cuz like I I was 16 and I decided I want to be a filmmaker and then two years later or year-and-a-half later you basically I got I started making steps to become a filmmaker and then I ended up working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really really good I'm cinematographer I really good I'm freelancing to Target for those that lives in Sacramento that deal I think so I'm proud that I had a dream and I went for it and I actually ended up doing stuff to go toward my dream that were in my dream so I guess that's one of my biggest accomplishment which was like over 10 years ago but I know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or no perfect goodbye cool,3
601,I'm going to bring her up for a short minute you're going to be able to see what she looks like an anchor back down or okay there she is yes I am I'm doing well Southern California the diversity and cultural cultural part of La having many different ethnicity ethnic groups and the restaurant the violence in the poverty no I play with my cat and I like to play games on the computer people that lie people that try to deceive I tend to ignore the person very good I argued with my mother about a month ago and what about how she had somewhat disrespected my wife welding disabled dream job would be helping people in some capacity I used to when I lived in Italy while going to school a very close my mother and my father my mother's always been supportive of me and has always accepted me whether I have done something right or wrong and my father was the exact same way before before he passed away I'm content with it on my wife via no no yes about two years ago year-and-a-half to two years ago I think I'm not sure kind of kind of got tired of feeling the way I was feeling yes yes it's a place to discuss my problems and learn Solutions on how to deal with them yes ways to deal with my problems and how to cope with things I'm more positive about things now before I was much more introverted and I didn't like to discuss. I was never comfortable I was never comfortable discussing my problems with people and by going to a therapist it is allowed me to trust people discuss my problems very good no no major changes no I do not easy I don't have any problems going to sleep cranky I don't like to be around people earlier today I had some good news given to me by my mother and it was even related to me as related to my aunt and just make me real happy hearing the news I bet I'm one that perseveres and that regardless of my circumstances I will make the best out of something,0
457,turn on yes spectacular this is an interesting experiment I am from middle of nowhere Iowa May 2nd of 2007 so exactly 5 years at 6 years ago and frequently like once every couple years the weather exist so it's more extreme and then it's exciting winter in Minnesota I took approximately the drive-in that's that's about all it took the lights the lights took care of the rest I really love that it's a giant concrete playground at night time so that bicycles have free reign of the streets I like all the art I love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and then if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here oh you know the traffic the exceedingly High Cost of Living I'm sure you can not nearly as much as I would like to have been a little bit I like not knowing exactly how things are going to go like the fact that it forces me to deal with people to deal with situations in ways that I normally wouldn't have to last year I got to hang out in San Marcos for a little bit after I split up with my ex and then after San Marcos I went back to Iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then I brought my little brother to Los Angeles last week managed to go on a bike ride for ciclavia as I use basically a Rolling Green Light the entire way down Venice Boulevard and so he made me made a bunch of like national news and was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on topics and stuff they we didn't bat an eye we didn't blank because it has normal for a friend that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately I was just at a happy normal Sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal Sunday for us is Extreme for everyone else I used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you Los Angeles once I found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing bombastic for the first time and it stuck if I weren't already the most relaxed guy already I would probably do things but when I'm really stressed out I do all sorts of stuff usually I tried to enlist my friends call me doing art project what temper panics cuz I really wanted to make him not hate me and I mostly failed hard on him I mostly unless I got by with a couple of scrapes on my Hugo when when that all went down I tried to talk to him but I got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of having my rubber gloves up I managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over trash cans it was not my most graceful moment something you feel guilty about I feel guilty about lots of stuff I feel guilty about eating more often than everything else because I really love junk food it's really good and I have very little food will power these to be that guy tell me about the hardest I'm not sure what the hardest decision I ever had to make was made a lot of hard decisions I guess it's very hard to leave Los Angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but I wasn't even that hard cuz it pushed me to do it so tricky questions oh you know Brooke collarbone severe pain get surgery on the LC like the time tell me about know my numbers are important I have lived a spoiled blessed life and if I changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe I like this universe little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me my mom is crazy and my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy I'm pretty crazy but since most of the rest of them live so far away and don't have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparse jackrabbits been pretty positive influence Mi lately she is a magical creature well there's a part where she's intensely physically beautiful is the part where she manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return smitten what a funny question how do I know them as though she's multiple people how did you know I know her through my bicycle friends the hard part is going to bed but as soon as I get to to sleep land time pretty much there until an earthquake hits so I can get to sleep poorly but then I'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and I'm pretty much the exact same dude because I've been doing it most of my life so stoked that I might as well be on fire because the universe and its infant I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Archer City Park Simon's ISO as a fortunate and vaguely aware being it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this yeah my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and feeling more and more inspired all the time if I could just work on the motivation I'm beside have you ever been not since you asked me on the phone a little while ago now I know I used to think I had it but who knows at this point those while ago I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun and then the rest is ancient history 2013 working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling on our project that all my friends helped him put on that's that was pretty nice that's a nice feeling awesome a very good question I'm not actually sure I'll have some later today though I guess I'm Susie Astic I am historic and I am I'm going to have to say highly analytical be nice if I could get my superpowers back would be pretty cool like turning on some of the fancier finely-tuned and delicate Machinery that Chinese medicine has clued me in to inside myself to play tough one I think the thing that I'm most proud of would probably be I'm not actually sure 00 all sorts of stuff I'm working on that don't masturbate so much what are some things that you Jackrabbit really bad puns and dessert no problem hi Ellie okay what a hoot,3
438,okay yes I'm doing pretty good I was born and raised right here in Los Angeles the weather would be number one I also like the diverse cultures I like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and it's a lot of opportunity here not just for myself but for my kids and I think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school learn about different people the traffic the cost-of-living sometimes I think it's too big and that thinks the transportation system as far as the Bus and Train is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation I travel when I can a little bit here and there I have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so I've just travel domestically I try to take at least one trip a year somewhere I just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places I'm going to take me somewhere I've never been and learning about that place you know like so if I'm going to DC I really look forward to it cuz it's the historic City you know things like that my most recent trip would have been DC his last year I went to go visit a friend and I stayed about I think three to four days and they got to see the capital he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the White House the Capitol Building I got to see a lot of other different government building and it was it was a good experience the irony was I had to fly on 9/11 and so that had me a little and easy but once I was in the plane up in the air I was okay and it was all good and once I was back home I was like yes but I I just the trip and I look forward to going back attending my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in Hawaii actually Maui that was actually 233 years ago 3 years ago and all I guess and I've been trying to get back ever since and I want to take my kids and I just love it there and actually come look forward to two moving there one day I have three sons 13 year old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they all have birthdays in June the twins are June 9th and my baby is June 4th and so they just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over plays hormones puberty is actually an interesting time because you know the two older boys going through puberty their teenage years still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of 8 to 9 years old so he'll be 9 in June and then my oldest if you 14 so it's a challenging time for me as well just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent everyday and seeing how just with love and nurturing and the right and you know when I can take proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and an Italian man is so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and see how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they are going through now that's so reminiscent of my teenage years and it's just it's very rewarding in and actually I look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and often college cuz I really love children giving back probably a couple of things but I was just say for me being a single parent is the financial well I would say that along with some of the emotional with them having to Bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing you know the just the everyday things so what you have to deal with sometimes when you just tired you don't want to be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that okay I got to cook or had to go pick my son up for I had to take him to baseball practice this one wants to go for hear this one is acting Moody and you know just those those types of challenges that's what was the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you keeping up with the day today and that's those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with well I just take it day by day. I just put one foot in front of the other and I'm extremely spiritual so I just rely on God and pray a lot and meditate if I see a need a little help if you know I'm not above asking for help sell sometimes if I have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you don't try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably I studied Communications actually I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I'm studying business I just thought that you know there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs and then I you don't have a desire to go to graduate school so I just figured in the long run it was a better it will put me in a better position give me more opportunities with the communication just a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of TV report and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought it I would going to something more realistic and you know but I like both fields are really do I like communicating riding reading talking as you can tell and sell the sea a couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer going to different destinations trying different foods out writing about different people cultures learning in living you know about those different people and culture living amongst the you know that the people there and being interacted with the children and stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fall back will be the counselor and social worker something in that area if I could Encompass all three hopefully I can that I would like to do that that's a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy in the not so much shy as I am reserved now but not Concerta but just reserved in you know what I go somewhere I'm checking everything everybody else out and then once I become comfortable or activates his situation and I'm like okay you know I warm up to the to the situation of the people but I'm also friendly I can be very friendly and outgoing you like to talk you know I seem like a chatterbox but I'm not really so usually if I'm in a big space with the whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but I overall I am open Friendly person for me I could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture if I'm able to I like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial you know things that will I pretty good sometimes I'm just like I don't really have such an issue with the temper as I am I just a more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people you know situations so I just can become really irritated or irritable quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patience outside of that I'm actually pretty good I try to be very you know conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is like if there's a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be I do try to be patient and understanding cuz I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to explain that to me you know what my kids sometimes you know it's just a works both ways to lymphocyte time of the month I'm just I guess just leave me alone or I might have a short temper or short fuse so I am conscious of it I try to be aware of it and then try to monitor it but you know like anybody I'm human and there are times where I have my days are moments when I catches like I go off and just lose it well I haven't really had not presenting an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express so I would say because it was not a personal contact with a company it really was an argument but I do know that I had some issues with American Express had to call in a bottle and I think Saturday and I'll tell I wasn't getting the response I expected inside look at the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rap was trying over talk me you did I was trying to talk her so you know I don't know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know I just like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that I was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning that would be really up to delete an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express actually was on Sunday yeah and I know the person trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so just are kept raising my boys said some things I shouldn't have. And just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there my blood pressure was raised excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while feel like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and as far as always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how I can handle things differently but that's when I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite what have probably have had a couple but police demos is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably by twin there probably about 2 and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time and he pretty much scheudle was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and I wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but you put me under so much stress and you know kind of thing I want to say really push me into having terminating the pregnancy and that's always stays with me and I've always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that that baby or what could have been I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody but it but I know deep down inside secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward so that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally like a deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems but that to me was the heart thank you no OK Google I was laid off in December so I've been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet so that's been a little tough and I had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so I'm at my range of emotions have just have been just that arranged at a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you're on the same place about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and going with her lies and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her masters in social work so I'm feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year but more so recently although I'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it back of course you don't got it when she was me so that she was kind of been bothering me well I'm really good with them people I communicate well I like to talk really good with children that's why I would like to teach her be a counselor although I haven't got really tapped into it I know I'm a very creative person I know I write pretty good I could possibly be a creative writer but I know very creative soul is given the opportunity I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with Maybe song writing fiction writing but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything cuz I love musical of Arts I love drama love plays Lubbock fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so I think those words are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people I know it would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time I have a good ear for listening I'm a great mediator and I know how to because I've been through a lot and one of my friends call me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduate from SC but I know I'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to Insight and wisdom and I don't know what to do if you don't have an older parents myself or how I grew up or I have had very traditional so I can parents who is still a lot of Great Value thin me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign I'm a Pisces but I'm really good with people just so you know. You know like I said I have my moments but I know if it's if it's something I could go into a developed I would do well really some of the situations or wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children pick a different partner and I say that mean my son's father is great but a great father for my kids and I was too much as a partner for me we're not together we have been together in years but I'm just saying over Ross had I yeah I think I would say if I could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when I should have in my phone right my dreams and goals and doing things that's like animals planning initially and I think that's that would I honestly be the one thing I could say I regret is not following my goals and I'm finishing school on time and episode when I really want to do stay focus and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody to tell you I think I'm pretty stable and consistent just with overall thing come how I faced adversity house I face things you know I'm a pretty committed person I try to you know if I say I'm going to do something to try to stick to it I'm a very loyal friend and them are proud of the fact that I've maintained that a pretty good job of raising my kids so low okay great thank you bye bye okay,2
617,wow okay I broke it not so good okay all right questions and then when she's done she should say goodbye and you can press this button okay okay should be how good yes I'm doing pretty good originally I was born in Denver Colorado I like the beach sunshine pretty girls the ocean other things smog excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with I would like to travel more seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun I'm probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that why have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in or for business as well now I look for work I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree it'd probably be to own my own company that's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working in I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there I kind of see where to go from there I guess my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him pray couple times a week they're good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he's married as well that's a good question lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike something like that on a daily effort for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn't like to go off on people they didn't do anything wrong Edward change the topic in my mind I guess what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse and that kind of gets the trouble and basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it's just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and going from there or it's probably a lot to do with the money as well I don't have the best financial security at this point that's a good question oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that's it's not for me anymore only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn't really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while but I I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just move forward and perhaps going to school like I'm going anyway I have I was 21 I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn't have much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought are you happy yeah yeah I'm very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult no problem movie think I when I got out of the military versus I'd I invested like I said into my friend's company and we started that little business we're doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally living the dream that's a good question I would say well it didn't and instills you with with very good I think since of sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don't get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can't get that same Edge and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you I've been feeling okay I've had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I've been feeling okay actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts and I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it's actually helped it's it's very as I can't really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that's if I'm not tired you don't sleep you just lay there it's Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I'm exhausted and I don't like doing pills pills are bad I didn't understand that but it's basically just can't sleep because either you're on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I'm not doing anything that's not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can't be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't when I don't sleep well perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix I have not that I know of no I I don't know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I'm not certain I'll say my my dad's been a very positive influence that's a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough a good worker I'd say I really enjoyed jogging the other day on the beach something that I am most proud of I would say I'm actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience all good she said goodbye okay,12
478,okay yes all good things the East Coast for work I rarely I prefer it out here it's not as nice as the lifestyle out here I like the weather better and there's a lot of things about living here my favorite city so somewhat baby sleep what's that just stop I like to go to France a lot I like the food there and just a lifestyle the shopping that sort of thing art history and marketing avail I became interested in high school and I thought it was a good classical education and I interned a Dandy Warhols magazine when I was in high school and so that yes yes I'm pretty happy with what I'm I'm doing I do Consulting so I write marketing plans that sort of thing it's really hard about writing a marketing plan I know it's hard it's hard to talk to someone about who's not marketing it requires just knowledge of you know how it's how it how it's done and it takes several months to to do lunch well I guess I'm originally kind of shy but I become more outgoing just cuz of work and stuff I like to exercise I do hiking with my dogs we walk up and down a hill a couple times is that good I don't remember I don't know nothing comes to mind sometimes I don't I don't clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and I feel bad when I tie should always stay on top of that just getting to the carwash and stuff well I had a conflict with my brother and so I had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense in that was a difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior wasn't it wasn't that difficult but you know what it was somewhat difficult because I I love him very much so I'm not close to my family so my I don't really have one I have a Japanese friends I think the center came up I have a Japanese friend I'm very close but she's like my kind of my mother and I just met him socially I don't know nothing comes to mind yeah I think the sensor came off Ohio okay okay easy cuz I keep a regular schedule I'm just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable a good well I'm recovering from PTSD so I sometimes feel that the PTSD and then I'll take a medication for that no it's just that it's just left over if that I'm still of the stress from it I'm still being treated for it but they don't really have any imma try not to talk about it I'm in the past but it's treated 5 years ago I was I was just very sad very depressed and so that's why things iety so I went to the doctor and they helped me that I did a psychotherapy the app for the PTSD. I don't know I guess so it's just I'm just kind of supportive because of the issues I have with my family it's it supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and yeah it just gets me good feedback and helps me to make a decision that sort of thing yeah I have nightmares about my family sometime nah I just try to sleep better I should I hide it before I go to sleep I sort of like meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help I do have you all the time pretty much like I am a dog's make me happy and you know my life is really happy I guess you know it's a nice person thoughtful a good friend and happy fun person I don't remember my forties now so I'm pretty happy with myself I don't mind you know I've done a lot of work on myself and in therapy and stuff so I'm pretty I wouldn't really change a lot I'm pretty happy with myself and I'm about to sound conceited but I'm I'm pretty happy with myself now oh that was that would be on my parents they're very abusive so I that I don't talk to them anymore so you know any times with them you know that they did Terrible Things today so I prefer not to talk about it I like to see well I just started reading a book I like to read cookbooks and I was just reading a book called on when French women cook and it's about a woman's relationship with different women in France in different parts of France in the end the cooking and so I'm really enjoying that book I usually you know I'm get the grocery shopping done which I enjoy I really I really like doing the grocery shopping I go to a few places and then do a bit of cleaning and dime just I relax oh yeah I would I would say to have better self-esteem cuz I just have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so tonight I wish I'd been happier in the past and you know taking me a long time to become unhappy because dinner no matter what it what I did whatever she meant I was I was never happy in the past I was I was always in a struggling with being depressed I didn't even know why and now and I realized because of whatever then set it that it was from my parents that I'm a relationship and so my advice would be to not have a relationship that is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best place in abusive relationship I'm just the way I live my life the way I treat people I think you know and I I believe it that your Deeds are very important that I try to treat people in a good way and I'm proud of my work and I've made that that'll give me a job that I like a lot of flexibility and I got to do what I like and and you know people like my work and then also making my dogs really tired of them and okay thank you bye that was funny yeah and then just do this,1
468,yes I'm okay with this I'm pretty ass a little tired but some pretty good for the most part on Redondo Beach yep at the beach or the mountains I love it go surfing in the morning or snowboarding the day if you're hiking up in these mountains Santa Monica Mountains to be exact I don't like the traffic I don't like the congestion a few people here and I don't like the price of the cost of living in specific areas I'm sure you can tell by my I've been trying to actually last year was the summer of really Road trippin and getting out there if my girlfriend we're looking at a Costa Rica and hopefully South America this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the South Seas in the southern states but I've been in a Canada been to Mexico and Ecuador iron been to various States here and they're trying to get out there I love meeting new people I love experiencing new things trying different different foods that are native to that local area and she's part of the journey I just I love exploring this you know this planet we call Earth just recently went to Seattle and Canada with a couple friends and who's gorgeous we have flew into Seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to Vancouver Canada and saw British Columbian why was he gorgeous just very large beautiful trees the the climate was nice the ocean was right there's people are great it's just a fun trip all around one of my most memorable experiences was probably the the trip we took the Colorado last summer and me and my girlfriend flew into Denver and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people were living there and just the day before we had contacted them and tell them we're coming the area and they're just showed great Hospitality they picked us up at the airport lettuce crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their card it's for the state and go to Wyoming and see the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just everyday is there something new and fun to do yeah I study business management and economics right now I'm I've always wanted to own my own business and I figured Mansion PA Agera Foundation to build on and I'll learn more about so I decide to go to management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and then economics was just too just for long-term Investments are really want to start running some stocks and ETFs and mutual funds and start building my profolio up so I figured now that would be great way for a long-term investment financially so that's why did my economics yeah I'm really stoked was one of the best decisions probably mine my life I consider myself more outgoing them I'm pretty friendly hiking don't mind to open up to people and stuff how to be outside like to go hiking want to go working out the gym but I most like to be outdoors I love nature and just be outside just just puts me at ease from pretty good for the most part I'm pretty mellow chill guy and when I do get angry here and there it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before I know it I just it just blows over I don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just cuz there's no need to Life's too short for all that see I can't remember the last time I argue with anybody I have no idea probably when Maya my brother and my girlfriend got a little little argument I'd like to birthdays ago and it's been awkward kind ever since I wish you would just handle that right then and there rather than letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties I was just go to communicate with both of them and told them that the differences aside and was just communicating try to come up with a solution but now it's just awkward yeah it does tell me about the hardest the hardest decision I've ever had to make and the Tuffy I don't think I've had too many tough decisions really say the hardest decision I've ever had to make on maybe not moving to Colorado for my undergrad to three years ago was a little touch of slick kind of think what if but other than that nothing has really been too tough on my life that was really that hard of a decision when you feel guilty don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person I think and for the most part I can think of any then so now I could wish I could erase my memory nothing really be honest I love all my memories are usually positive for the most part I know it's kind of wait for somebody to say but I've looked pretty good life and I'm happy yeah it's cool I'm pretty independent the most part so when I do see him here in the ants if we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but I want to see if it's good you know I like to say hi and show him I love him still and it's not that I don't mean to like not contact him that you're always contact me but it's good for the most part I guess is a young adult my girlfriend's family they've been very positive in my life I wasn't for them I think of you in a different direction just in high school I didn't really care about higher education I didn't care about really thinking long-term and I just seeing them and what their family dies and how they think differently like through higher education and how to get somewhere in life and if you do these things is to work at will you too and they've been very successful they own their own no accounting practice and seen that influence me to achieve higher in life pretty easy for the most part I just close my eyes and wake up in the morning I'm tired sometimes it's enzyme a little drained and maybe a little groggy in there and that's it showing pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just cuz finals around next week and I really really want to do well and just seen a close out this last semester and I graduate in two weeks and for the most part that's that's one thing I'm really nervous about but for the most part I'm really excited and looking forward to going to Maui for a week after graduation fired up and fired up to see what the future holds we're going to be my girlfriend 11 weather trips are planned for the summer I'm just excited be done with school for a little while yeah I have never been diagnosed with PTSD I've never been diagnosed with depression the last time I felt really happy with paci my girlfriend graduate couple days ago she had just graduated from nursing school on Monday and I just hear walk across stage and stuff just cuz we've been together for 6 years Tina go through the nursing program for 5 and it's just ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just drive through and Achieve what they wanted to cheat and just been really proud of her yeah probably outgoing friendly Positive Vibes all around adventurist love sports team player knows how to be a leader in there and it's a little outspoken sometimes not really for the most part no not really feeling more motivated to do something motivating right now I'm just because I'm just done with school and I'm over at that I just don't feel as motivated but I just want to be more motivated and determined right now and that's not I'm not going that way right now so no biggie how man I couldn't can really think of a Time Owen caving 2 weeks ago that was a lot of fun we went up to Sequoia National Park and I went caving with the trainer CNA classes like this site Recreation tourism management class and Kayden with an elective and our professor was at the world-renowned cave specialist and they took us to these various caves in the Sequoia and just me and these strangers are my classmates and becoming really good friends with him was a lot of fun and rappelling down in a cats climb back up going through different rooms and shoots it was a lot of fun Dallas yeah 10 or 20 years ago I'd probably say to stay more focused on school little lesson the social aspects and kind of stick with one sport to see how far that he got you sometimes not playing hockey hockey sometimes and that's pretty much at now I'm proud that I'm really proud that I'm graduating my bachelor's and I'm looking to get a full-time job or get a law firm now so I have something going for me really try to be motivated and determined person long-term long-term thinking lies and well-rounded person and I don't want to spoil the world some car proud that I open my eyes to that and now I have different perspectives and really about open-minded people and rather than judging I mean on Celebrity why not let them do what they want Anna I'm really proud to just be a finally getting my Bachelor's and hopefully going for my MBA in a couple years thanks for sharing your thoughts for sure bye all right house interesting,4
434,yes I am I'm doing very good today I'm originally from Chicago Illinois moved out here when I was three yes I never go back family issues it depends on what you're into if you're into the fast life and Hollywood it doesn't compare at all if you're into the cold weather than you would rather be out there I like the sun my mom and my dad split up it's okay I have no idea I was only three when I moved out here I like the sunshine I like the weather I like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter fall and end in the summer I like the beaches I like Hollywood I like that the Lakers are here and I love the people is is a different variety I think La is a microcosm of the United States people from all over the world come to the United States and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to La for a better opportunity so that's why I like about la no gang violence no not really I travel one time to Arizona and one time the Stockton California and another time to Barstow California but I don't do much traveling right now because of finances study alcohol and drug counseling I just filled it in my I just got into my heart that that's who I was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addiction so that was kind of easy choice I got some advice from people and I just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and finish school it internship and got hired and so I believe that's what I'm supposed to be doing with my life I'm not working right now I actually moved away and I had to I was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so I actually had to give up that job in order to make that move but since I came back down I've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interview so I can get back into counseling well it can be it can be very difficult at times because I have a felony and and so I can't work with you and I can work with the elderly and but the regular dose I can and then you have to be certified and I'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even like you to take the test you after work a certain amount of hours so right now I'm just trying to get into interns you know try to intern and show people what I can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen them my resume and yeah they just want people to be certified not being certified the experience and the fact that I have a felony makes it hard and my dream job is to open my own facility or as an author you know that the that depends on on on people mainly I mainly adapt my personality to the people that I'm around if people are perky that I'm going to be perky if they're standoffish then I may seem shy but I'm not sure I'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up but if people open up right away then I open up right away I mean listen to music or I watch YouTube write poetry I'll just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like I could sing which I can't so that's and nothing I do is I eat ice cream controlling my temper I'm very very good at it it depends on what it is I have to say that last time I lost my temper because I felt like somebody was scaring my mother so I lost my temper but ninety-nine times out of hundred I don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and I just like to be calm and cool and I like everybody to be comfortable I don't want anybody be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it I just believe that and I believe angry outbursts to be a link to heart problems and high blood pressure so I definitely don't want that well I was just telling you about it was it was my mother's husband and tell you the truth I could have handled that differently but when I seen the look in my momma's eyes of fear I just lost it and I snapped you know I told my mother like I don't like this you need to take care of this because I'm don't know how long I can keep my composure as far as this cuz I've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so I kept my distance in a relationship but when I saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me dad I don't like very much because I know if I get angry I usually stay angry for a long time so I should have just left I should have just left and went home and rested and got up the next morning with the church but yeah we had a big Time Explosion and they had created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those 6 9 months I can't get back yes well my brother in prison I haven't seen him in 20 years he's been there 20 years my sister move to Chicago 13 years ago I haven't seen her since then so I'm only close to my mother and my son I haven't seen him in 5 years and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and how that's going to turn out for me I just you know I have small family and I have family in Chicago but I don't mess around with that side of the family just just because of what I seen and heard so I just don't want it to happen to me at all so I just keep my distance has been a positive influence in my life I would say taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and talked taught me how how to like monitor my emotions in monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when I just need to be quiet until that intense spelling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not just emotionally and of course he's he was the one that told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor he's got 27 years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that I'll never forget feel guilty about my grandfather pass away in 2004 and at that time I was just getting out of prison 2002 I was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer but I didn't get it cuz I had a lot of drugs and alcohol my life at the time and my life is crowded with things that I consider to be more important than that plus the fact I didn't understand him what he was saying but when he died I figured out that he was telling me that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but I couldn't see it then and I feel I think about it all the time erased from my memory will be the date my brother hit my mom I always Replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like that's what Memories I can just go without replaying my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there I feel conflicting feelings because I want hand on way hey my brother was protecting me from getting beat and on the other hand he was his my mom so time in the middle most nights I don't know I go to sleep maybe 3 in the morning and I'm proud I'm more than likely up at 7 in the morning so I don't get much sleep it depends it depends on the environment I mean if I don't sleep well I'm going eventually I'm going to be here to boo but doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if they're difficult people that's going to be a challenge for me and if people are easy going and no one would even know that I didn't get much sleep I've been feeling lately I just been feeling like Dad things are about to start going better for me maybe some better decisions taken advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me so I'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen I'll send out a million resumes I don't care if I get 5 interviews I've I've never stopped because I know know that been a counselor is my life mission and and I'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because I found a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and I have a lot to offer Humanity so it's just a matter of time before that the public is exposed to what I've been Gathering my behavior I'm more mellow I laughed more more humorous I let a lot of things go that I used to just let take me off and anger me and things that I can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and you just can't control that I think I matured mentally and psychologically and and the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so I know my thoughts of change and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed I still have to monitor it my thoughts and my behavior I still have to monitor them but overall you know back then I just tolerating myself now I actually like myself and it will boo boo hoo you to feel the same way no no I haven't no last time I feel happy was last night cuz the Lakers won the basketball game my best friend was described me he calls me the truth because I always tell the truth and people tried to hide stuff and I always refill it they can't hide it from me I have a statement that says I see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and I see stuff days and months before they start happening I no human behavior when I see it and I sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that I see through them like I said like a clear glass with nothing in it and yes that's why he calls me the truth I wish I would have never well obviously I wish I would have never went to prison I wish Falcon change well my economic status my employment status my teeth that's like a problem area for me I did a lot of stupid things years ago and it caught up with me and I didn't take care of my teeth and now that I need to be confident about myself as I can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like I wonder if they look when they're to look in that might if I never get the I never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there she starts that says are they looking at my teeth so I will really change that and I will change my physical size I think I would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier but I'm working on it 20 years ago which would make me 18 I would have at that time I was a big-time high school basketball player for Fremont High School and I had college is coming to see me and I would have given myself the opportunity was the to stay away from the troublemakers because I didn't and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils and who knows I could have been playing for the Lakers last night but hey I'm most proud of the fact that you know what I'm most proud of my mom really really she graduated from school she got a full-time job she got a full-time job she would wake up at 5 in the morning go to work get off her job at 3:30 go straight to the college lead to college at 9 at night she does this 5 days a week and still had the strength to maintain of she was on the Dean's List and President's List so doing all of this you know when they say that older people can do things I just think that's dispels that rumor and she recently got her license as a evangelist in the church so I'm just real proud of that and her life is been affecting people in a positive way so yeah Mama okay thank you goodbye okay oh did you know that she stopped oh okay okay,2
392,hi I'm Ali thanks for coming in today are you okay with this yes I'm doing well California I like the weather I like the people I don't like the traffic that's primarily it sociology it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects now to be a writer can you tell me about I like being able to write what I want to write right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in like what like articles about a teenager culture stuff like that I think they have it pretty easy and I know how easy they have it I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot at no not really okay you can see yourself more shy depends on the situation or who I'm around when I first meet people I can be shy but if it's someone I've known for a while I can be that guy I'll lay down or try some shirt like deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun in my numbing like watch TV I'm pretty good I don't really let anger show that much I'm not like that I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that I'm pretty rational when was the I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was cuz it's been so long what's something you feel guilty about because I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should I'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family cuz they basically serve raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much I can't really think of one right now I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing yeah yes is the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband what made you decide to do that because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but I still felt like I should stick it out how hard is that I mean it was hard at the time but I made the right decision I think my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age can you tell me about that she's just a very strong powerful through staunch character that rubbed off on me so good how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep not really super easy I sort of I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late just heard a foggy and distracted and trouble concentrating okay how did the feeling lately you mean like my body normal fine no complaints and same as ever no last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff how would your best friend describe probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring bunny radio I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around reading or going to the movies watching TV is everything your no I don't think there's that I don't think I think regretting things is a waste of time advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago don't try to don't go out of your way to try and press people if they like you than they like you what are some things you wish you could change about your sometimes sometimes I can be kind of lazy I'd like to have more of a laxative better work ethic I guess it just sort of putting off stuff until you know right when it's due or after its do things like that procrastinating okay tell me about a time when someone made sometimes for the things that I write people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website that'll make me feel bad I'm articulate and funny and a good friend I guess I'm most proud of the fact that I and satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it I'm just hanging out with my friends for people watching watching a movie that's good listening to music,1
402,okay great yeah how weird therapist that she talked back oh my gosh wow and I'll explain after this is over how it all works just like nobody like making her do anything are you can tell me later okay okay so what do I do just do what she says okay and you said if I don't want to answer I can just I don't want to answer the wild okay cool thank you okay are you okay with that yes so how are you doing today okay Atlanta Georgia in 2006 never I don't like it there it's completely boring and there's very little to do la is preferable I think to most places because I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida I moved there to be with him and he loves the water but I love the mountains I missed hiking and I love Florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we can both be happy and also have more opportunities in business and all of the great things that I have to offer very easy there's not much I don't like about la I love La I think it feels magical so many creative different people of all ages shapes sizes colors races the mountains of water the city all the things that there are to do all of the different people there are to meet I just I love everything about la no I'd rather not talk about it I didn't go to college I'm still figuring that out I don't know it may may have something to do with animals I have a dog that I really loved and I never had a dog as an adult I had cats and I think I'm a late bloomer so I'm working on that whole conversation I don't I really don't want a job I want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run it depends on the situation but in general I consider myself more Scheib although most people would consider me to be outgoing sometimes when I'm feeling I turn on the fish tank screensaver what do you do put on classical music music classical music especially stressed and play with my dog go for a walk I think I'm really good at controlling my temper for the most part before I came here it was just about them Financial stress there's probably a lot of examples I think I'd rather move to another question yeah I'd rather not talk about that either I'd rather not talk about that how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep not very easy at all I'm a lot better recently but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time in the past week I've been feeling a lot better tell me about that yes I the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer as having more trouble with my depression in the winter and having trouble with tolerating cold and so I wasn't doing a lot of the things that I normally do and I also was sick with the flu and in the past week I decided that I was feeling better enough that I needed to kind of get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day and walking my dog everyday and not isolating so much sing some of my friends more so I was feeling I've been feeling a lot better like I've been making progress and that in the past week things have taken a more positive turn no yes it's been quite some time of officially it's probably been I don't know exactly but let's see maybe more than 15 years ago I was feeling suicidal no because I found a better alternative I've been there be off and on since I was 18 and I'm tried a variety of methods and then I started working with some neuro-linguistic programming her and that was really the first person that helped me make permanent changes and I was able to get off my antidepressants as well and even though I struggle with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and I was one of the best things that ever happened well I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome and I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her of that disease and that was he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so once I had my first conversation with him I knew it was the right step for me I'm so happy I felt like I was some I felt that I found the answer that I've been looking for that I hadn't given up hope panda I would like I'm glad 9 that I had been suffering for a long time and I felt that I finally found the answer to the solution that I was looking for I was like every last thing I ever did in my life or the best decision I ever made extremely helpful for the first time in a long time I went to I went to a music store because I've been thinking about I'm taking up an instrument I used to play the violin as a child and I've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because I felt it's been extremely depressed and numb that's how I went to the music store to try out to see what it would feel like to to handle and the instrument again and see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue it was awesome yeah I'd rather not talk about that well that's probably a lot but I'm always working on being more optimistic it's been challenging it takes time but I wish I could hear my own internal voice better yeah I have regrets sure value myself more so that I would make better relationship decisions my fiance is the most positive person in my life my My ultimate supporter tell me about I think very unique not the not at all selfish and the probably a little too giving for his butt always has my best interest at heart has the highest morals of anyone I know would give somebody the shirt off of his back is a genius and so many ways and I'm pretty lucky I think that I'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time I haven't given up on taking risks and,11
458,so you guys are controlling the virtual human okay yes I'm doing fine thank you I'm from Los Angeles California yes I love man saying I like the weather I like the lifestyle I like the variety of beach know we have it all things I don't like about La the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have I'm well-travelled nice enjoy. I enjoy seeing new places going new places it's different every where the people are different it's fun okay well the most recent is last year I went to family reunions in New Orleans so that was in June and while I was there we also visited Slidell Louisiana for the the swamp tours and Vicksburg Mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in Ferriday Louisiana with my aunt to will be 101 this year in May there's a lot as far as traveling or just. Most memorable experience and well I don't know if it's just one probably when I used to travel with my dad that's where I got a lot of my traveling from can you tell me about yeah it was best car sometimes planes mostly white just I guess I'll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips just a general and also drama what's your dream job my dream job is to become a real estate investor well I've sort of really been into it every since 2005 I just don't have the capital right now or the connections but since I do like real estate I'm just going to start off as a real estate agent so I should have my license sometime this year outgoing I'm well I'm not sure why it could be a little bit of both but I'm pretty outgoing well speaking of Hawaii I did live there for a year and a half but what do I do to relax is either I'm usually take a nap take a bath or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways it needs to be worked on but I know when to control it when I need to well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments is this just over a text message but I'm actually it was my fault but usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control butt that's usually how it goes well I don't know what else to do except for pray on it because I thought once I moved into another house it would be over but I see that we're still getting into it so I don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right than them be right I guess probably quite a few things but I don't regret anything I've done in my life but situation I wish I would have handled differently just kind of everything in my life almost I could have done it differently or I would if I had the chance but I'm not worried about it cuz I don't regret anything that I've done in my life tell me about the hardest decision probably when I had to get a divorce that that may have been the hardest a one of the hardest decisions it was just a lot of a lot of stuff through the years the relationship is kind of deteriorated the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing I would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because I would feel like well our relationship is good and it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he's doing this so I I just decided just forget it I mean I tried but you know he didn't want to cooperate so well I'm happy with what's going on now I mean I wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes I am happy with my life right now yes something I can erase I don't think I really need to erase anyting I finally got an over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that I can't think of anything to erase it's fair / good there is no problems right now so I guess I'll just say good yeah there's no problem well I would have to say my mother yes I'm with she's just always supported me and everything that I've done whether it's good or not so good so I think that's a blessing sometime sometime it's not well I just don't get enough hours of sleep I guess that's what it is cuz I would like to sometimes so that's more the problem I would like to get I'm just sleepy yeah sleepy tired feeling like I want to go take a nap I've been feeling fine I know they've been about the same have you ever been no no I'm really happy probably last week because I got over to a little bit of money so well I guess my best friend will be my mom or maybe my entertainment friend that I've been knowing since 96 I really wouldn't I'm not going to say I don't consider him a best friend that we don't really hang out that much but he is very ungenerous to me and my mom so well right now I spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in but maybe after the class work is out of the way maybe I could do something else myself well I do wish that at times I could control my temper a little more and of course I would like to lose weight be a little bit more active and I wish my skin would clear up it was probably when I was in school school years or terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so they try to make you feel like you're nothing like your piece of turd on to their foot so that's probably the last time is an adult now I would say that I'm genuine I'm honest I'm supportive and I'm just a good friend no did you give yourself well 20 years ago just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like people tell you that's the main thing I'm I'm going to tell my daughter's no I'm just eat as you normally eat the eat more healthier there's no need to gain 80 lb when the baby is just 20 pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose also know if I came into any money now 20 years ago I was probably just thinking about shopping or just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff where is now I would invest it so yeah I think that's about it proud of I guess maybe myself my kids hey thank you bye,5
413,okay and please are you okay with this yes I'm doing okay I'm from Greenwich Connecticut yes I moved here in 2008 so about 5 years ago I try to go back at least once a year sometimes I go more sometimes less overall I think I like where I'm from better than La in general that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to and less superficial I understand Monument all my move got here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California initially it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally Fine Arts in photography I was interested in photography since high school yes I have a fine arts degree that I got last year and awesome are you happy you did that yeah I really enjoy working or interning in forensics I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting Centrist in question I guess just my childhood in general growing up while my family is very close my extended family as well and they all most of them live within the area on the east coast in general so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that yeah it is really fun and we try and I'll get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries I consider myself more shy sometimes when I'm feeling hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got what do you do I watch reality television I think it's kind of funny and lighthearted like what I watch Like Bravo TV like The Real Housewives shows and like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to I'm good I guess I don't really have like a temper from having if I'm more stressed out it definitely shows in my attitude but I don't have like anger when was the last time you argue with someone will me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things but other than that I had an argument with my dad a few days ago can you tell me about does Ben like some tension going on since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the 30th time he we were on the phone and he was telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend cuz of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me you'll forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I I don't care about having a relationship with her so she doesn't want to hear from me you know it's easier for me I mean every time I mean that's been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish that I could sometimes I do but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or thinks he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so I kind of just like lose it and I can't really like not say anything well I guess the hardest decision I made which I didn't really realize that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to go after you graduate high school where you go to college because for me I've basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like the progression of The Next Step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory I wish I could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but it wasn't seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory come she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental and now I mean my parents are great role models just in general I mean they're very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that were separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older usually it's easy the problem is staying asleep no matter how late I go to bed whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. I will be up like clockwork by 7:30 or 8 in the morning the latest every single day and I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer I need to record buy something no I just in the morning I guess I'm a lighter sleeper but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this is consistent but now it's I cannot remember the last time I slept past 8:30 in the morning I mean it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day and makes a lot more tiring but it doesn't really I'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of every day okay how you doing lately I don't know I kind of just feel very like so so just no extreme highs no extreme lows kind of one no land I mean nothing like lately like recently it's just I would say over a. Of years I kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing no no I have been diagnosed with anxiety I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital cuz I thought it was more serious cuz I couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety I think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it if they're open-minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing then yeah no I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me but it was never so I mean we just sat around and talked about my day wasn't it I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time so I didn't really get much out of it tell me about I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday when I'm there I can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation I don't have to worry about paying bills I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow who I have to deal with I just do every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day is there anything you regret in general I regret the college I chose to go to I didn't leave from the East Coast the whole Collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the university is out there or not the same as like the tight-knit California school system out here so when I was researching colleges I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general College just like Boston College back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it I didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went so kind of crate created more problems for me well cuz they're M22 if probably 10 years ago I would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and 2ave really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California how your best friend describe you my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me which I mean I don't I mean it is what it is I I am very outgoing in and have a great time when I'm with my friend in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things I just I am very shy and don't really speak match recently my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that I'm very caring I am a very good judge of character which I mean I guess it's I mean I consider to be a quality for myself and various I mean never affectionate I'm more I mean I guess I guess so thanks experience I can chat with you a little bit more about,10

the years I've been around since 1952 and I was born here in Los Angeles and I see such changes as far as environmental with the smog and basically that's about it I'm sure you can tell them I've judged several places in the United States yes trying different type of Cuisines I like to go to museum like two historical or a historical buffer going somewhere different than where I've been here

the boats and stuff with it it was just it was a good experience and it's another place I went to I took a ferry in it and my mind went on blank on it I can't even think of it right now but other than that New Orleans I didn't go to the Mardi Gras just I don't like to go when it tomorrow to growl when they have a lot of people I just went on the offseason I enjoyed that and I've been to Atlanta Georgia and I have taken a cruise went to the Caribbeans I took Mexico cruise by next cruise I like to go to the Alaska because I want to be able to see certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as their Environmental I'm outgoing as far as going places I don't have a problem eating alone I don't have a problem meeting people I'm only shy and conversing back and forth to a stranger oh I have a favorite thing I like to go on the internet and I like to do sweepstakes I'm a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contest and I've been very successful since I was a kid I've won a lot of sweepstakes and in the evening time I find our time and I just go online and just I'm so good at I know just about exactly the right time to even entering I usually try to answer them before midnight when everybody else is asleep so it's been successful for me getting married having my children I have a 27 year old son and I have a 31 year old son both of them when one of us married though it's not and I just not too long ago became a grandmother I have one grandson and my son he works for the County of Los Angeles assessor property conveyed convenience as amateur and the other one is the computer engineer So and I've been married for 33 years and strong you don't want if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to him and find out what's going on and tell them that you love them on my son I talk to him all the time when he went out the door I love you and even today when they're call me and hang up a said Mom I love you you always have to give them that that good feeling when they leave the door that you care and I never had to go to head to any jail to get them out they've been pretty obedient I mean boys will be boys but I never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble and I'm very proud of that especially the boys I don't know how it would have been different but avoid if I have to say it was pretty obedient and they respect the law the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and I've watched my son like I said just grandmother and I watch him how he handles his son and it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how the hell his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey I got a wife I have a son and it's my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads so it tastes off and I asked nicely he treats her well my mother was more Stricker on me but my parents for some unknown reason I guess because I have my sister and I were the girls like they weren't struck on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go a lot of places and then my parents are so they weren't typed it like to travel and I used to look at them and say no I'm not going to be like that now I'm going to travel I'm not going to just stay home and I don't mean that is nothing wrong with him because they downtown love is home and do things at home but they never really travel anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and I used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere and she said well I'm going to go here I'm going to go there but you never did she died she never needed to do any trouble so I made up for and want to do something different in the next two to travel more than and be more out there I was more of a social butterfly my mother was not a social butterfly so I made up for it I think before I speak and then I am the type of person also to take on other people's feelings before I blow out the wrong thing I try to analyze the situation first because sometimes you can put you open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you would not be able to get out of it's probably something about my husband yet I know it was this new construction that my husband is working on our house we had a disagreement on that then have their own way of doing things and I had told him not to use a certain person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so I didn't say I told you so but I guess you can tell by my facial expression that he'd have done wrong and I told him I said look you losing money and it became one problem after another so now I'll do a construction thing is up in the air right now cuz he knows he has done wrong and I'll but he doesn't want to face the fact that what he knows it but he doesn't want to really face it back so he says I look smart project with our project so I grabbed this one of the biggest arguments are we having right now that I can think of this recent I felt that he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at cheap or economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways cuz I told him that you need to do your research I'm the type of person I do my research before I jump into something I asked tried to. My eyes and cross my T's but my husband he's not like that he's fight I can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so I don't care I mean is he license he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he could just jumps into it witch costumes some extra money unnecessary money that is spent on the end I mean it's a lot of money and so I was really very upset yesterday I was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could have say can we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didn't make any sense I retired early I was very fortunate to retire at age 50 I retired in 2002 I was working for the State of California Disability Alice and what happened was I was able to reason why I was able to retire so early because I've been working since I was 18 and I had like 31 and 1/2 years of service and we was so nice about it that I only needed the best in like 10 years in my health insurance so I was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire I've been with kelp her and I know if you have a counter but if we have excellent retirement system and since I have been working with them so long I didn't get the full percentage I should have stayed Thomas 55 but I got out of that 50 and I didn't get the full amount but that's okay I found myself going back doing a little part time job because of the economical reason and then I have one eye that's so I think that was the kind of mistake I did I should have kind of waited till I was 55 and 50 but I look at it now as far as the health insurance I really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and I don't pay very little money so I think that over the gates of the money that I receive you see the hardest I probably when my mom died cuz I'm not used to anybody dying and my mother died in 99 of non-hodgkin lymphoma and putting her funeral together my brother and sister we never we will never face with anybody dying of putting a funeral together and all response because I am the eldest it was put on me and I'm like oh my God what I do is so it's kind of like trying to find her insurance policy cuz I had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and try to get all the stuff together and finding things you know I myself I keep my things organized time for some unknown reason she didn't have her Sargon eyes and I think that was the hardest and knowing how much I have to pay cuz I had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and I'm fortunate my mom this is interesting she had one of those small Barrel insurance but she had $1000000 of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with no accidents he had local conditions so that was something that we had to pay for the whole just about everything yeah it was it was but now I can handle that this is something weird but since that I've learned from that so I'm I have made it available for my children that my husband died we got together and we want him getting our insurance policy. Insurance policy but what do you call the Bureau Insurance be at that and it's just that we've had it for many many years so it's almost payday advances 10 years of pay for everything and everything and nothing that I did I've even written my own obituary I know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that I don't want them to go through what I went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on and he said he don't want anybody to have any problem people I didn't tell him what to do it's already written we did a living trust it's nothing they can do but make one phone call and that's it I have no problem sleeping very well pretty good I didn't a little tired but that's only because the physical condition I have found out I have vitamin B deficiency in vitamin D deficiency self is more physical but not mental exercise walk walking more saw no not really no no I'm basically happy all the time I'm more so I'm making other people happy I get more phone calls as people want inspiration about things when they have projects they working on and then I try to encourage them and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey I really appreciate your input thanks and then they are I'll follow up on them and see how they're doing resource person I've been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because I'm the type of person I research everything I get into just about I just don't dive into any situation I tried to look up information some I know if we have the technology here that you can get everything on the end of that but I also go back to the old school like that like even finding this place I mean I did the map Google but also I love the Thomas brother I never going to give up my Thomas Brothers map Yellow Pages you be surprised I Don't Give Up by Yellow Pages so there's certain little things that I don't really let go I know we have technology sometimes she's going to be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology get you have it right at your finger but you can find things and then they say I'm more Barbie first person the most people come to me just to just look up things and I get that that's as Funk about it because I like to look for stuff and find it and that gives me satisfaction I wish I could have stuff going up and down on my way to lose weight diet before the summer time and and then by Christmas time I have what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if I can stop binging and making food my friend I think that's it's a nervous disorder I did I like to eat and but also I don't like to be overweight either cuz I have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and I can't get them on right now so I know I saw them when we go on this bench and try to lose weight for the summer time so I can get a no so nice I'm sorry I didn't hear you no not really I was ready and I can stay skinny again back on I see you and I'll be home by 10 or 20 years ago I would have stayed a little bit more money before I retire instead of retiring too early what's Providence is on my life meeting a lot of people that came in my life I got good friends I still have 15 of the best friends that I went to elementary school and in very where you can find anybody who can walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends we were in the sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter fact we just had with all of us and our 6-year birthday and our high school group we put together a 60-year birthday reunions and hear all fifteen of us with the exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so I think it's basically keeping the same friends I think we can probably outlive me okay you're welcome bye bye okay alrighty,1
424,where's my little button are you bringing okay all right yeah she looks like human okay okay alright okay you're welcome are you okay with this yes today is a wonderful day I'm doing just absolutely marvelous I was born in Cleveland Ohio I was raised in Tucson Arizona and came to Los Angeles when I was 16 years old yes I've only been back once since I left Soho another Community when I was going up I'm so glad I grew up there because it was a great sense of community which I think we don't have here in Los Angeles my grandmother died and left property for my father so we came here to manage her property property it was pretty easy for me I was still young and it was easier to adapt so I'm pretty good at meeting people that has never been a problem I travel a lot as a child so I was used to moving and going to new places meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and I like The Adventurous life oh one of my best troops I had it was in nineteen I'm dating myself but 1964 I came out here to visit my grandmother from Cleveland Ohio and I went to an Indian reservation and I got a little note card about the reservation when I got back home I wrote to the reservation and I told him I when I went back to school in September I would have to write deliver a speech rather about what I did over the summer and I told them I wanted to talk about going to the Indian reservation and what they send me something and they sent me this huge Cucina Indian down and that was that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if I still had it I found out like a quart of a million-dollar so but that's one of the best person I can be a little bit of both I'm pretty when I have to be I can be outgoing cuz I'm good at talking to people and meet people but sometimes I have a little bashful side-by-side me to the little bit of both I study business administration with a emphasis in marketing and advertising I'm really I started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't is what it is today and I'd like I was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and I love people so I wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so I wouldn't a marketing and I was working for a TV station where I was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so no now I'm a photographer I'm a celebrity photographer I shoot a lot of stars I shoot on the red carpet I shoot a lot of special events and anything of people will pay me for it's not hard at all this my passion I love it is like not working I'm in my dream job I just need to get more jobs that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as photographer you have to do a lot of things event for free to get known so it's a building process of relationships I'm still in that process of building relationships so that I can get more pay jobs but this is my dream job I love what I do okay well now I'm really back into it I used to do it a while that I got away from it but this meditation I practice meditation I try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before I go to sleep I work with Oprah and Deepak Chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and I use that too I can really control my temper sometimes I get set off I guess like any other human being but I work at trying to keep it moderate and temperate temperature and personality oh wow we argued with my daughter the other day about something I said and I did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her and maybe what I said did and that's what started sergeant oh God I felt terrible because I never intended to hurt my daughter and I never wanted to hurt her and I feel bad that she had been hurt by what I have said I had to have the guard my word to watch my thoughts but I don't have much of a relationship with my with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughters and makeup artist I'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes I think we're up on each other to close we need a little more space yeah when I say the wrong things no is never easy to be a parent it's like working progress making the right decisions about things sometimes the love the show look feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a wonderful and productive human being I'm not as strict as my parents where I give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are I'm not real religious like they do but I am very spiritual so I brought them up different from me on the religious tip and more I listen more to them I think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when I was growing up and I let my kids voice be here what's something you feel guilty about one night I had a bad night that changed my life and I don't want to go into details I feel bad about that night yeah I could have stayed home go out and trying to think about it and situation maybe those handling of how I me and my husband divorced I think I could have handled that a little differently well we we I think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and I think both of us could have handled it better but I think I played a part in keeping a lot of drama going because I was hurt that we were breaking up and kind of devastated because I wanted my child to be raised for their father so I think Looking Back Now which is you know hindsight is 20/20 vision I could have handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you do better tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to the hardest decision I've ever had the hardest decision ever had to make was I was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on the plane had a stroke was going to making a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that I could not get on that plane because I might have another stroke it was a hard decision cuz I was in Dallas Texas all by myself I did not I mean I was in there with the employee but I would be left all by myself cuz my employees have to go on to Montgomery Alabama where we were headed and I had to make a decision should I stay or should I go but my life was in the balance so I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one overwhelmed I mean here I am on my way to work you know I flew to different state every week and they help kids get get admitted into college and here I am on my way to work and I'm on a plane and I feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and I say my prayers when I go to sleep and then when I wake up to get off the plane I can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which I did every week so I knew something was wrong it was it was when you see your life in the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and you know you don't know what's happening to you is so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience I'm sorry but I'm here you know I've survived is a doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and I survived so Universe wasn't finished with me yet how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep you know it's that sometimes I have a little problem with it sleeping a little bit sometimes I I get wired up I get wired up just because I'm one of those real energetic persons and I have to finish what I set out to do and until I finished I can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep by the time I can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head what are you sluggish probably a little on edge but I try to keep a puppy personality I'm really energetic person so I try to but you know if your tired your body is still talking to you so lately I've been feeling really well except I've been having some problems because I have a since I had two stroke I have nerve damage in my head and in my face and so I just it's I thought it's been over a year since I had two stroke but I thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it has it but I'm so grateful to be alive that that is really my minor compared to the bigger picture and I wasn't fortunately my I didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are I still can use my hands I still beat you with my camera but my left hand is is diminished and use but I can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so I can still keep doing my work so you know I have to keep a good upbeat energies going on for me to keep for me to be successful no but I went through depression from being knocked unconscious five times and I was a schoolteacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and I suffered from having like sleep apnea not been able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head no only I don't go to therapy because I don't I don't have any medical right now so I'm not able to get therapy they only offered that to people with medical hard to get it and I'm not work yet sucks I'm not working right now because I'm still trying to get my disability so that I can get well cuz I'm going to be a fulfilled human being and I want to be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before I go for a hearing so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years I've been working since I was 16 and it's taking me it's been over a year or the year I had two stroke February 2012 and we are now in March of 2013 and I won't have a hearing until September 2013 just to tell me if I get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because I'm wondering where I lived off my savings in the last year and I got put my daughter through college you finished and now she's having to take care of me and she still looking for a job and my life is kind of up in the air right now and some wonder what goes what comes next and so I'm just praying for guidance I feel happy every day every day I wake up and I can breathe and I can see and I can walk and I can talk and I can still shoot my photograph I'm happy it's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive and you know what I figured I'd look at it regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just move for it what advice would I pay myself don't let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality an energetic spirit and just keep pushing energetic talkative won't take no for an answer follow through reliable good-spirited giving loving I'm most proud of that I have been able to find out my creative side I've been a visual artist I never took an art lesson before I taught art I was in my late twenties before I even discovered that I can draw and paint I'm a doll collector I'm at my creative side is what I'm most proud of because it's been able to help me being creative I can no matter what even when I was still very ill from having a stroke I could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to myself that I'm glad I'm glad that I have a creative side of that I found it and have utilized it is that it why no that was kind of therapeutic that really was therapeutic. Go back here okay oh okay I'm sorry,3
403,thank you at the door hi I'm Ellie are you okay with this yes how are you doing today I'm doing really good I'm from Granada Hills California it's the San Fernando Valley part of Los Angeles I love the weather I like the diversity in people I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one racer kind of food I love the beaches all the activities you could go do the theme parks aquarium stuff like that museums this smog there's a lot of creepy guys I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I've pretty much child around La I've been cross-country and back three times twice with when I was 17 what do you enjoy about I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live I want to hear when I was seventeen I ran away with my boyfriend to Upstate New York to Watertown it was a like a Navy Army kind of town we had an apartment there are it snowed a lot we sold antique Spirit living awesome getting calluses pressed houses for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through friend and getting to meet rock stars and hang out I like the private parties I'm very outgoing I love people sometimes when I'm feeling what is the fastest guy what do you do am I go to the gym and work out quite a bit I find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going I really notice if I don't work out a couple of days I feel a little more tired than normal and is it helps me feel good I'm pretty good at it I'm very I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and I kind of started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that I didn't know that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean and you know and I wonder like if you're talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is LA what's something you feel guilty about I really don't feel guilty about anyting decisions I've made in my life I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass what I'm doing I grew up in church so I haven't gone in years but I still have those values and you know the rules the Ten Commandments and stuff in my head I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called you know the proper authorities and follow through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code a few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming early and going back home I decided to move there and I had just started you know this business is doing event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experienced something new or stay and what I was doing I was I had a degree in Dental Assisting I did that for like a year I didn't like it and then I was sending Communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism I'm somewhere I'm doing a van work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where I'm controlling my own riding and what's going on instead of writing for someone else I always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art growing up I really like Connie Chung she was like a Channel 4 newscaster in the eighties and I love Barbara Walters I was a nerd relationship with your tell my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom I never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me I have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them and phone we just communicate on Facebook or like Twitter how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep so I go right to sleep when I get tired I just go to sleep how you been doing lately three good energetic I've been motivated to go look for more van work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than I was I mean it's kind of hard cuz you got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer the one I know dies I want to say that I'm just super like oh my God happy all the time but it's like an even Keel that I feel pretty good all the time I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them Eddie's and I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or group of people that I'm used to I could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adopt what are some things you wish you could change about you I want to make more money I'm over in like second grade the people used to make fun of me cuz I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's were in the highest grades and Lacrosse so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe stuff like that very talkative she would just say that I talked to everyone and I'm very friendly and if you need help that I'll help someone you know a recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hang out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like chicken in the park and played and it was really nice and they was cool visiting or I didn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again and I like the area I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people I think I pursue it but I think maybe I could put a little more time and day into it tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory I don't really know anything like that we want a raise or not happen okay is there anything you regret no I feel good about my choices I made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do than balls rolling and I'm you know getting things done I'm not as big as I want to be but I feel like I'm on my way

magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep riding and keep doing the Vance and keep on the ball I'm rolling and he's one of the biggest people you know my life tummy you're

I'm tired of groggy I'm a lot more likely to my Angry sloth more likely come out feeling lately I've been alright this weekend is been better than most my girlfriend is stayed at my place the entire weekend so I've been happy I don't I'm not as irritable no but yes I was probably how is I believe I was 12 the first time I was diagnosed haven't diagnosed multiple times though most recent time being less than a year ago on my mom's side help for me she saw that I was unhappy and she became worried no I stopped in on June first when I graduated my drug rehab program and Utah with last year learn coping skills so I'm able to call myself down when I'm angry easier I I know how to stay away from me my trigger points and getting away from staying away from being angry we're becoming depressed it can be if a person is willing to change and wanting it 2 days ago can you tell me about that it was because I was with my girlfriend we were having a moment I was just overwhelmed by the happiness I guess trustworthy funny shit I don't know going smart athletic he would ya what are some things you wish you could change about your I wish I wasn't I was so short fused I wish I wasn't depressed I wish I didn't feel like I needed something to help me sleep I wish I was just completely Dependable on myself when I was younger my father would he wants it my dog in front of me because he's mad at me so he's are hitting the dog and I don't know that was the biggest thing since I was little I remember if something sad yeah I ran out something that you regret give yourself not to be so naive something I went to a hypnosis I had a phone appointment for dinosis few days ago how is relaxing really calming and I feel like you could help me I'm in my mom's colleagues referred her to psychiatrist who's really good with ADHD in patients like that I'm athletic I'm nice I like to I put other people before myself what's the time enough at the negative quality or positive I I don't know ideal weekend I would either go to a few parties are all hang out with my girlfriend in Fullerton or I'll be in Los Angeles or the beach I haven't really felt like I've accomplished anything to be adequately Prados but I did very well and Sports in high school and that's really it,16
483,sure good I guess New Orleans Louisiana a 2005 I used to go back often but not much anymore just think happened well I guess you're not programmed with Trina happened in 2005 not really tell me about that where to begin just has different culturally have a different culture out here it's just a different place it's it's bike-friendly Louisiana isn't New Orleans for that matter really isn't now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful the drivers the crazy not really kind of but not much anymore don't have the money kind of broke just being able to go on an adventure I once went to Comic-Con on a on a bicycle like on a 3-wheel bike and that was pretty fun kind of scary and dangerous new I got killed it was scary traveling or just in general I got to say I got to say we were we were heading out of we were getting off the PCH and going into Laguna I'm going to have this really steep hill and on Sundays it's full of traffic and I remember going down that the hill and my brakes weren't working and I was trying to hit my brakes and try and hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't quick and I was like oh God and I'm going to throw you all bikes on larger than most bikes and I'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going downhill unable to break and I'm going down and suddenly there's the car that veers right into the century where I'm trying to go so I turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any breaks and like not managing to keep my bike from rolling which is painful when your bike rolls kind of hurts a lot so yeah noted various different things at Anthropologie visual effects kind of weird but yeah I've always had a fascination with film and I think the white people do things and go about things as fascinating just as like that the mob mentality of people especially dream job huh I have no idea did the job I guess I consider myself more outgoing you know I've never been afraid of what people think of me why people don't like people I don't know I'm not I'm not afraid of what they think I'm more concerned with like the people I know and what they think of me I guess so being outgoing just doesn't really affect me play video games listen to music yeah read books I like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games did I forget anything sleeping I like sleeping that's fine not good and high school a I shove somebody's head through a locker yeah yeah that that's not good don't ever shut someone's head into a locker that's a great way to get suspended I don't know things like that just getting into fights like a serious argument I guess like argument over over I guess over like a like viewpoints on like that control and gun control laws I mean I was like yesterday evening it was it was an argument about you know gun control regulation I mean it doesn't really affect me personally but that was like the last argument I got into I want you specified I think my entire life I have about two years ago I broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil Acts and yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad I mean I think I've calmed down a lot since then what is a person as a whole but I mean I was angry and stuff I think I like one riding my bike for like a hundred plus miles in a senior day and I was in a ton of pain like later in the evening I got home I was like oh God like I can barely walk and yeah I think running off in like going on like extreme cycling spree was not good but is better than like eating too much in like just over eating cuz I was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like I wasn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death I don't think I've had a singular hard decision I've ever had to make because my my biggest thing and why don't you know don't regret don't regret the things you do just regret the opportunities you've messed and that's like had to come with me that's like hats I've had to like learn that in the past like 2 years like two years ago I totally just cannot grasp that concept and answer your question I think thinking about it the hardest decision I've had to make is I'd say probably probably to break up with my ex probably where do I begin my ex was not a good person and just in any way shape or form of the word she did some things they wasn't entirely comfortable with just took that the people around her and to me I you know they say You're supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and I just I think there's some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and I think there's something that wants done but they can't be undone they just their through the way that they are and I think I think after what she did I like I just did things just fell apart after that it just to spite us trying I just didn't work out I mean I don't know I don't really want to talk about exactly what happened emojis oh man erase for my memory or just erased from ever happening huh I don't you know that's hard Katrina just the experience of Katrina for starters my ex I guess between those two it's it's going to hurt at that actually rather lean towards Katrina cuz that was just that that was not I mean I guess you don't exactly know about it but in 2005 does giant storm hit New Orleans Louisiana killed a whole bunch of people level the town and I'm also at a friend's during the storm I mean I'm kind of getting over it but it's still it's still there and I think I don't know I mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is just think that was like a freak accident will never happen again I live in LA and you know earthquakes can happen I just think I'd rather rather know that it's coming then not know it's coming have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD yes yeah depression it's record multiple times that's no surprise first time I was diagnosed was in Middle School which would have been ten well ten between 10-12 years ago I don't know I don't know whenever I was in the sixth grade that's my first was told that I was depressed as far as PTSD goes post-katrina and then you know post-katrina moster that was the big thing I guess having been diagnosed previously is being depressed and still being in high school it kind of wasn't I wasn't really seeking help its kind of I got that kind of got into my high school and then we're like here's help cuz we know you're going to need it and I was like oh well thanks I didn't really ask for it but okay I'll take it you know just kind of happened no not not anymore what's a good question you know I was like I'm not going to do this anymore sometimes sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and you know it's kind of well I'm feeling fine right now but ask me in 2 hours and who knows you know I guess it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happened just happened and to just get on and move along with your life essential just like carrion you know things will happen carry on tell me about the last time you felt really happy wow I was I was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out for starters I mean you can't see when I walked in but I'm walking with cane right now cuz I got hit by a car recently and make my leg better what's a chainsaw over there that way but anyway I don't know I make myself less fat how to make it so I don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day ohm kiss when you sleep like more than 10 hours a day it's just some productive if you waste too much time with guy friends who are like oh you know I feel rejuvenated after 6 hours and I'm like how do you do that I have to sleep with 12 hours to feel good when you can sleep 6 you know like in an crunch time you know you can get away with for I have to get away with seven or eight you know like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule 8 hours it's just I don't know I oversleep but I like sleeping to I'm just the oversleeping part I don't like so much utterly insane in a good way I'd really insane in a good way I guess like that they would also say like you know that there are times where I might seem like an asshole and I'm not really an ass-whole I just you know I just have issues like everybody else specifically I have Asperger's so that's a form of autism I'm not just kind of makes life awesome did also say I'm flamboyant an eccentric cuz I totally am I just I don't know I figure I'm still alive so I should live because I'm still alive do you know who knows how long I'm going to be live for so I should you know Live While I'm Alive and just go out and do stuff not not sit and be calm except when I'm reading I like reading stop fucking up know it's kind of messed up I think I would have told myself at the time because I have known my my evil acts I've known her since like I was like six and she was five I think 10 years ago I would have grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl don't trust her she can't be trusted and more importantly don't don't let your guard down around her cuz show show exploit that I don't mean like physically let your guard down not mentally yeah don't date or just don't do it it's not worth it it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain it's not worth it the fact that I'm still alive Maybe yeah I don't know cycling the Comic-Con I was pretty proud of that pretty proud that I managed to do it just I don't you know I don't really know I don't really use the term pride and I really feel Pride I'm just it's more like the fact that I'm still alive I'm proud to be alive I don't know if that makes me humble or just insane who knows do I press the button now I'll buy okay to who do do do do do by the way her eyes are really creepy just saying that it's just the way that they say that they have the uncanny,15
409,everything right this is you want to go alone okay yeah okay well what's up just want to see what they look like to I like to try to be aware of like how I'm answering which means about her it would be okay okay okay alright oh I see okay I got you okay what was she say okay okay I got you then alright thank you hi are you okay with this sure doing okay I'm from my la yeah I like the weather I like the sports teams like the entertainment it's pretty much the same you're wrong as far as the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's kind of like a mixed bag and I guess that means I'm kind of used to it by now so be nice to explore other areas I will draw my life having too much traveling so it's a little bit of a kind of a Readiness to it but overall it's okay okay I like the computer programming and operations but that's going back to the 70 so it's technology has changed a lot as you can tell the last 40 years that's right that's why I chose my major yeah I know it's kind of this kind of inquisitive it to get to use your mind you was like your brand-new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know I'm back in the seventies now it's turned into computers but back then I was sort of like something very unique you didn't see too many computers around back then and then programming so it's kind of been to the logical together solving a particular problem he'll come up with a step-by-step Solutions on I guess I'll sort of the analytical Ennis of the year the problem I know I kind of FaceTime still use computers but I haven't gotten I've been have been in programming for a long time well I kind of got into an another area kind of divorce Intuit diversion to another area my life this is going back to the late 70s I kind of took another turn and then by the time I got back into it was I kind of got into another field so I never really pursued it to the degree that I wanted to what's your dream job wow that's a good question I never thought about that ironically actually pretty simple this point in time this is kind of like a little bit depressed and then I am at this point it kind of just wanted to kind of just do a nice relaxing job but I do want it somewhat of a challenge but I don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking it's almost said what I was back in the in the old days you know I just want a nice comfortable relaxing job but I can feel fulfillment on but I don't want to chance of a situation kind of point in my life I just want a nice relaxing job yeah oh I would say well the most part shot because once I get going I could be outgoing but I'm shy to begin with and then I X I can listen up and be more outgoing and spend I can take it to the extreme arm talking too much like once upon gates open at the kind of open up too much so I have to like back off now but overall it's a I'm kind of shy as it is a general demeanor okay sometime turn on the fish tank screensaver yeah well I listen to music by watch TV just was what it would do to relax a stressful situation so I can have them stay relaxed Elsa talk to my friends to I'll be around an area about kind of a comfort area where I feel safe I can just dialogue with people so kind of gets me out of my think about my own problems I'm having a kind of just you know focus on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances I'm pretty good I don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to to explode I think when I was in my younger days I think it was a bit more had a little bit slight bit of Tampa never had a really bad temper but tempers not really an issue I have to be pretty mellow easy-going wow that's a good question I'm not sure to be honest I don't think about that for a long time and to be honest I can't come with an answer on that not really part of my repertoire nothing comes to mind. My head well well don't say anything on the way back and made some bad and bad Investments back about 10 years ago how's more Charlie like what I'm looking for more trusting of people like that people in like them I thought were expert in their field and I inherited some money I was little bit careless with it and I just kind of had a Vibe you know that nothing would go wrong kind of little bit of night-night tivity and unfortunately some bad financial decision is kind of put me in a bad position for the rest of my life and fortunately he got because of a medical conditions I have talking to rebounding you don't make it all up so I was saved mainly financial and investment decisions that I really regret tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to me wow that's a tough one I can't think everything about my head okay well I don't really have too much family left the only one I have is my it just me and my uncle and we could we communicate on a regular basis he look but he lives in Clearwater Florida so long we were okay but he's like it isn't he's in his eighties and I was young my my 50 so we can we do we have kind of small talk and he's kind of concerned about my well-being but it's kind of somewhat of a on a shell of a really deep and that he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation other than him it's really there's not really anybody else to have I did that part makes me a little depressed cuz I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on a really confide in it is challenging I don't know why but I do have a medical condition something that might be part of the problem and I have a little bit of BPH so I'll be out of town for the restroom and answer your question to make a long story short it is challenging to get a good night's wake up feeling a little bit tired aching but it is difficult how deep is feeling lately well I've been feeling okay I mean be kind of feeling now actually trying to address issues that I haven't taken responsibility for but I feel a bit of calmness as of late have you ever been tagged no well I just say yes. The questionnaire and I'm not positive if it was technically diagnosed with it I did take a Venus call the mmph the Minnesota multi-faceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got two questions about my my well being psychologically too and I think some of the answers to the advice that I see a psychologist or psychiatrist I didn't follow that up on that because the philosophical differences but I think I might have a mild case of depression well you don't like I said I'm just kind of like kind of goat along in life and I'm doing okay but you know highlights passed me by so I haven't really fulfilled my my goal was kind of like alone I'd like to have a girlfriend I don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of tell me who I feel I can get close to and I'm not really in my life right now so what is a certainty I'm having some kind of financial uncertainties so overall not doing as good as I'd like to okay tell me about the last time you felt really happy that's a good one really happy let me think about that a minute well actually it wasn't that long ago actually I want you okay I know that one actually I think I'm going to answer I hope that old lady she was at a trade show it was a Anaheim with natural products Expo so it's pretty nice we we had some nice meals afterwards there's a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples it was an Anaheim some kind of got a chance to get away from LA and met some interesting people are they were very outgoing they're willing to like having experienced their product or service and I was around people that I work with who I got to socialize with old was pretty happy back then and it was about a month ago yeah that was best friend and I really have a best friend but I would say I don't know technically I really don't have a best friend so she heard me answer that so I can't really come with an answer to be honest I like to be conscientious and I do have flaws Mary but I think the overall unconscientious I try to be honest for the most part I'm on the major issues I might you know they would have likewise or you know I'm not perfect I'm not going to come to the serious stuff I tend to be pretty honest I'm a hard worker. Good work ethic can you be pretty calm for the most part play regret what can you elaborate on that well I just well just overall I regret them not be a little more assertive in my earlier earlier life if I put myself in this position is going to go back to my financial decisions that was sort of that sort of like my albatross in my life I made some bad decisions and unfortunately the kind of pay the price for now so I kind of like sort of like living sort of a popper existence right now which is kind of kind of depressing so I would say that's part of what I regret most of all advice would you give yourself 10 well I would say to really you don't analyze kind of go with what you really feel I think I was going with other people's opinion other people's advice I was kind of going away from my basic beingness you don't like the way I really felt like I'd make you aggressive investing which if it turned out good it would be like for like when the lot I would have been well off for the rest of my life but unfortunately it went the opposite way too many eggs in a basket so I kind of regret it going with my gut feeling and let other people influence me and I could by Nature I'm a conservative person so I should really do more conservative Investments another is my life at 10 to be more conservative but I kind of made some aggressive financial decision so that's pretty much can a local doctor that area as far as what I regret wow that's interesting I've been doing a lot of working weekends so well I do like to be profitable to do something where I can actually you don't make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time could you trade shows but I'm not doing that then I'm like maybe watch some men you know I like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game go to a movie go with some friends so just going to kick back but my main primary primary focus will be on earning earning money on the weekends huh that's interesting what's prerogative I would say that I live by and large all of the wholesome life I would say I never got myself into any kind of really bad bad advice you know I I love the pretty hoe salsa my wife I said I'll probably I don't really proud but as far as I stay the course as far as not going down any real deep to speak okay my pleasure that's pretty interesting is it improve your technology on a lot more like you're talking to a live person Siri it was kind of a little bit more Academy can tell us like a more like a like a video game this looks more like a real person communicates like return for not trying to deal with her but it was some other guys and I think I know what it was but it was a little bit more I can't reveal all the details but this is see no more comfortable more natural yeah,10
486,already okay great yes I'm feel great I am from St Louis Missouri born and raised yes I've been here a couple times I just recently moved back 2 months ago St Louis is quite slower I take care of a good friend is who who's ill thank you I jumped right back on the bandwagon things you really like it the climates the restaurants the dirt and the traffic I'm sure you can tell by my shoes yes I do the road maps following a road map may be driving myself but we just recently got back from Colorado what happened to the mountains so that the snow and enjoy the little fine dining in Colorado I actually going horseback riding through the Royal Gorge yes it was I would be more outgoing I'm a people person I listen to jazz music and I also draw I've probably mastered controlling my temper through age it would have been my husband and it was about financial issues and ensure unstable I don't like loud talking or loud emotion I like to sit in methodically and logically talk about things not raise my voice most recently with the illness of my friend I wish I would have handled his sister a little differently as far as things that she's wanted me to do that I really needed to tell her otherwise the way they really needed to be done I took her advice where I shouldn't have how do you know that we I was engaged to him 15 years ago and he recently called me I guess about five years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer we've always maintained our friendship and I asked my husband if I could go help him in this time of need and I'm here it has been a lot of things one he's a good friend of mine and his sister moved out here as well to my son wanted to start his career out here 3 I love the weather and that's all I can think of at the moment I would be the the death of my youngest son can you tell me about that I don't know where to start as far as he was born premature and since he was born so early I had him in 5 months versus 9 the we we made the decision to take him off life support cuz he wasn't getting any better so that would have been the the hardest decision I made with my husband I really don't want to erase anything from my memory I've actually learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so I'm not I'm not one to put things erase things out of my mind I categorize them and play some in memories that's very close lost my mother at a young age and Ava siblings and my father still remain very close my father always very health-conscious very energetic and exercises and has a spirituality about him that I want to have as well the contentment that he that he portrays that I that I would like to have as well how is your day no problem very confused or skittish I guess would be the word lately fine except for the fact that my good friend who I'm helping take care of we just got out of the hospital so it's been a little hectic the last 2 days no not lately have you ever been tagged no I have not no I have not I was excited with good friends and good company I should say and I just got back from a concert so it was outside it was enjoyable music I was with good friends we ate well and enjoy the moment as a giving spiritual normal person I don't know I can't think of anything that would want to change except for maybe exercise a little more I I can't recall one offhand no to have save more money + 2 not trying to accomplish everything at once I started out in cosmetology then I went into college have some college in mathematics and finance traveling I like to enjoy good food nice Wine & Company I just went last night to very nice Italian restaurant was in the company of good friends and family and we dined and talked and that was fun most proud of I guess it would be my children thanks for sharing you're welcome bye-bye,4
466,I was that man when do I talk okay okay okay yeah that okay okay it's better okay thanks okay thank you thank you yes okay Los Angeles the weather the variety of environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety I don't like the superficiality of people the narcissistic attitude just the it doesn't have a small-town sort of feel where you know just the warm the human sort of warms the interactively so yeah no am I have a fear of flying and I have developed agoraphobia incredibly difficult I'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying it's it's more of a recent development and it's it's pregret it's progressing to be worse it's very what's the word immobilizing and very distressing actually yes it is how do I cope with that just just trying to do the best I can and try to you know have the most courage I can in the situation and challenge myself and small steps I read a lot I do I'm bibliotherapy reading and I try to inform myself of the of the professional literature I'm so that I could hopefully over comment someday yes definitely certain things trigger at like enclosed spaces being in a car traveling being away from home being in someone else's car things that are outside of my locus of control add actually I don't go to school right now my dream job is to be a psychologist I'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is having lived through some challenges like this having lived through some traumas but I've always had an interest in it since junior high of I'm very interested in people and Men human interaction and human connection and the betterment of of of those things bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their child personal challenges so that's that's sort of in a nutshell I think I'm someone who's I can be very outgoing and sort of a warm and friendly presents very easily but I think on the exterior but I think I'm shy and I challenged it to do that I think it hard I'm shy but I but I challenge myself completely cuz I do love human interaction so I take those risks and and jump and those challenges the last time I interacted with somebody was today if I think I'm understanding your question correctly oh no I think I misunderstand your question but I I interacted with Rachel I just I'm continuously interacting with people take taking those risks a very good very good I just left them argued with somebody actually can't remember it wasn't recent I have to think about that I don't know yet let me think I'm drawing a blank I can only remember things from what I was like 21 right now I can't think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is okay I when I was younger can you tell me about that yes I lost a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousin's cuz when I was 21 on 45 I I had a disagreement with my aunt and I said something that was a critical of her and she threw me out of their home and let me back I apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives and change their minds so I regret that I'm assuming you mean how do I feel when they asked me to never I'll be in their lives again and to leave shattered Soul shattered heart shattered tell me about well that that was my family that was the good side of my family there's the majority of my fat they were they were the the loving aspect of my family on the rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive I'm I don't have any relationship with my family at all like there since I was 21 since my aunt and uncle disown me I guess it's the right word estranged yeah gosh I'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second something I could erase I can't even get it to my memory as an example I was injured and I wish I could get that away from my memory yeah I was injured in the emergency room doing I went in for food poisoning I was ordered to go in by a doctor I had collapsed and I was ordered to go into the ER for that I said food poisoning and I came out injured with a neurological syndrome I was injured with a what do you call it intravenous procedure and now I have RSD reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the scene in the emergency room was it was an out-of-control saying there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake and it was extremely excruciating it was a crisis and so every time I think about the injury and it was disfigured I got disabled got disabled for disabled permanently from it was also a disabled from my employment for a quite amount of a given amount of time as well and and it I have residual physical Trauma from it and disfigurement and severe disability disability limited functionality with my right my I'm right-handed my right hand and arm thank you tell me about the hardest decisions I don't even know what that is you know I I really I apologize cuz I can't really probably give you the most suitable answer I'm guessing it has something to do with my cat and her her urgent what do you call it I heard she was in intensive care veterinary care and I'm sure it had something to do with that but other than that I would say I had Choosing My Life Path weather and I was admitted to that program or whether I was going to go to art school for four years and I had to pick a life Direction but that's not a traumatic situation so I don't know how best to answer your question I can't I have severe nightmares and I have nocturnal panic attacks are you triggered by something and I also have physical illness on top of it and I'm in excruciating pain you have disturbing thoughts yes yes yes they're triggered by the injury that I told you they're triggered by my family how they've treated me what they said to me what they've done to me they're triggered by what else my my physical illness not my injury Olney but my physical illness as well so yes I feel very ill and feel so fatigued very ill and very fatigued when I don't sleep and get enough sleep at my anxiety level I believe is up and I'm susceptible to feeling distressed so yeah yes 3 years ago my most recent diagnosis and in 2001 as well oh yes 3 years ago and when I was 20 years old the my background my childhood from my family of origin and there are the abuse that I went through and their ultimate what's the word rejection of me and estrangement that was the first reason no I stopped 6 months ago why did I stop I'm just taking a break I'm going to continue yes very much it's helped tremendously I think it helps with anxiety at helps with it helps Inspire crate inspiration that helps feeling connected it helps to create what I ultimately my goal is to give myself a voice and it helps to to side is part of that process it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself and there's just so many benefits it's I'll stop right there and there's many more the last time I felt really happy is it was a really long time ago it was before my illness and it was in 1997 on the outside of my illness was in July of 97 so it was before that yes I was in a very good place in terms of my career in terms of my just my relationships and everything was just sort of at its best career relationships personal fulfillment start of as well I was very active and and doing a very many things that were made in full to build a life thumb and I was in the process of just in the in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at the same time so it's just that they were just going very well and I was just really liked just where my life was at it was just in a really good place and many ways I wish I could change about myself my anxiety I wish I could change about myself my agoraphobia my PTSD meeting my trauma and what else my insecurities as far as just with other people in the sense that I'm always trying to make sure that that I don't do something that that hold on one second I'm just trying to make sure that I don't do anything that's offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful and I I feel like I'm overly cautious about that and it kind of becomes an anxiety unto itself so I I definitely think that would be beneficial to change the other thing I'd like to change about myself and I wish I could feel and also depression I'd like to change about myself I wish I could feel better I wish I didn't feel so tired of the burden that I do love my family I'm not having one and what else I wish I didn't have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that I'm in so those are some things and I also wish that and this is a byproduct of PTSD I wish that I didn't have the the symptom ology of PTI say is that definitely affects one's complete complete life like her life completely and I wish I was more articulate and I wish I was someone who was well-spoken and someone was well-written but there's many there's many more things that I wish I could change about myself to improve myself so many more I'm not sure maybe to not be so trusting I trusted I trusted some medical professionals that you know again created the injury and it a word there's a what's the word there's an expectation and it sort of a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession and don't ask questions or just sort of you know and if not to trust your own self your own your own instincts or intuition and so I would I would have told myself to be a little more careful I guess if that's useful to your question what did I really enjoy and I can't think of anything specific but I know it would have to do with either reading or connecting with someone on a meaningful level I'm most proud of my compassion my my empathy and caring about people despite I mean I'm proud of it anyways but I'm also particularly am I come from an environment that's the opposite on the background and then the wasn't taught that but I really do care about people and I'm I guess I'm most proud of that I'm also proud of my career accomplishments and my tenacity my my Fierce tenacity to succeed and you know just also to get the strength it takes to get through the injury to live with it and to live with the illness that I live at the physical illness so I think that would be it yes okay you're welcome bye okay I've been crying and opening up to this person so I think I did but what you're what you wanted right I'm embarrassed cuz I got really sort of involved like she was asking questions that you know we're really at the heart of you know some of your pay and you know and I was
